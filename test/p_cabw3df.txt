review: amrut portonova

i reviewed this as a mystery dram over at /r/scotch, so i'm x-posting here in case anyone missed it.

**amrut portonova, 62.1% abv**

sample courtesy of hello_nasty.

&gt; more woody experimentation from the folks at amrut, maturing the portonova first in a combination of new american oak and ex-bourbon barrels, then moving it to refill port pipes and then back into ex-bourbon casks

* nose: very sweet. dried figs and juicy sultanas. a bit floral. cedar and leather. toast with marmalade and manuka honey. liquorice covered in chocolate. faint herbal notes at the back.

* taste: full bodied. syrupy and sweet. the dried fruits from the nose dominate at first. turns tannic and tart . sour apples and lemon zest. chilli dark chocolate. oaky bitterness. peppery and dry.

* finish: sweet resinous pine. pepper and oak spice. ground coffee. slightly herbal â€“ mint and basil. long and dry.

i like this a lot. similar to sullivans cove port cs (an australian port matured whisky), but this gets one extra point.

&gt;**92/100**
