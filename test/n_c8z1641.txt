thanks didn't even realize that, but upon second look one of them clearly states "pure malt" and the other "single malt yoichi". i may have to try and get my hands on some single malt miyagikyo now that i've learned this. this gives me a little more hope in my palette, i remember saying to the bartender that they tasted quite different than just 3yrs in a barrel, guess i need to learn to read. they are also bottled at 40% (12yo taketsuru) vs 45% (15yo yoichi) and they yoichi did come off stronger to us.
