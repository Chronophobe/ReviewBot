Jameson 12 Year.

Im not exactly versed on how to review whiskey but I'm a big fan of Irish whiskey and I can't recommend this enough. It is delicious, with a great aftertaste that lingers after the initial drink. Not to say the drink itself isn't pleasant because it too is incredible. All around if you enjoy Irish whiskey and don't mind dropping nearly double that of standard Jameson I would go for it.
