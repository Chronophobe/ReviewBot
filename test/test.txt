Greetings Scotchit, texacer here with another quick review. a special one this time, my own recipe blend. some of you may remember back when I bought the Large 1.75 Macallan 12year old bottle[1] . Basically I bought it because its more than double the Malt than two regular bottles and it was cheaper than two regular bottles. But after I refilled two empties, I had a portion left. What DO?! So I created: Texacerâ€™s Sherry Blend ~~90/91ish proof

    very flora fragrant.Carnations. airy Fresh red fruits. Strawberries especially. Acidic Sherry. Candlewax.
    immensely complex sweetness. fresh and dried fruits. Sherry and Port both come through. Light yet bold and rich. Strawberry candy. tangy Blueberry Juice. hints of fried banana and salted peanut butter and ginger.
    wonderfully long.

I combined: Macallan Cask Strength, Macallan 12 Sherry, Auchentoshan Three Wood, Aberlour Nonchillfiltered, and Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban[2]  . puzzle pieces. Usually when I blend things together, parts get muddled and cancel each other out. Like an Islay blend, they usually just taste like Smoke Peat and Vanilla after blending. This however worked really well. I can pick out different notes of parts and its very complex and not overpowering or muddled.
