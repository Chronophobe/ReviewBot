i got to try all 5 hudson's at a spirit tasting, here are a few notes on each:

baby bourbon- 100% corn, boring, forgettable, i wouldn't even been interested with more age on the product.

four grain bourbon- the only one i find mildly interesting. this one has a touch of potential, would try it again if/when they put some age on it, in a proper barrel.

manhattan rye- not good. some odd flavors, don't know that time could help this product either.  some tequila type notes in there as well.

single malt- super green, raw, young.  blindfolded you would call this a white dog.  it has gained nothing from it's time in a barrel.

corn whiskey (not pictured)- this smelled and tasted like diacetyl. the oil/chemical that makes microwave popcorn taste "buttery"

all in all, this is what is killing the micro whiskey market.  if i spent $50 on any of these (375ml bottles at that) i would swear off micros all together.  i would not recommend buying these to anyone.
