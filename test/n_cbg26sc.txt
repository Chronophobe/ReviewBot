discussion:

1. not too bad for our first one. what do you guys want to do now? should we do it every two months? i think it's unrealistic to have a monthly one (and i'm lazy).

1. we will rotate countries ie. next one cannot be irish.

1. yamazaki 12 will most likely win the next one. it's been done at /r/scotch. should we do it again or should i disqualify it from nominations?
