friend of mine aquired this bottle when it was not sold at an auction. only info i have in it is that it's supposed to be a 30 year batch from the 1950's and was a gift from some emperors collection. no english on the label aside from the name.  there is a serial number on the bottle but i haven't had any luck searching it. safe to say it was delicious.
