hello everyone, the bottles have started to pile up from swapping so i decided to get a start on them! so here goes my first /r/worldwhisky review!

sample bottle given to me during a swap with uncletobys.

**yamazaki 12yr**

**43%**

**local price: $90**

* **nose:** apple, cinnamon, sweet melon,  delicate lemon, slightly soapy. 


* **body:** no legs at all. very thin mouthfeel, almost watery. 

* **taste:** pineapple, apple, banana, light spice, salt, nutty with a little burn. cardboard. 

* **finish:** fades rather quickly. fruit and spice. vanilla. 

* **overall thoughts:** when they say that yamazaki is the best selling japanese whiskey i'm going to assume most of those sale are from the older expressions. luckily a bar in the city offers the older expressions which i might give a go as i have read/heard somewhere that the japanese whiskeys improve a great deal more with age than scotch.

 i really didn’t like most of what i got in my glass tonight. plus with a $90 price tag i don’t think i’ll be going near this one in the future. would rather drink a fiddich or livet 12 for half the price. 

edited/added some details after a second glass.

**68/100**
