if you believe the wiser’s corporate-speak, wiser’s small batch was an experiment by the company to test the waters with a richer, more robust, more strongly-flavoured canadian whisky. its success allegedly paved the way for wiser’s legacy (and thank goodness for that, at least). but what i find interesting is that some of the talk surrounding the small batch ultimately doesn’t seem to mesh up with the whisky that i actually tried here: wiser’s small batch *is* certainly more strongly-flavoured and spicier than many mainstream whiskies. but, if we’re being honest, not by all that much.

in other words—this whisky is more wiser’s deluxe than it is wiser’s legacy, though i do think that in the pantheon of mainstream canadian whisky brands, it’s still a respectable entry. it’s all about the expectations you go in with, i suspect.

**wiser’s small batch canadian whisky**; no age statement (though the bottle claims it is “double barrelled,” “double matured,” and “aged in virgin oak”; 43.4% abv (if nothing else, wiser’s deserves credit for bottling this above the canadian industry standard 40%); 750ml; retails for about $33 cdn. in the province of alberta. it’s also worth noting that i’ve noticed a small price jump to accompany the introduction of new branding for the small batch, which once looked like this: http://i.imgur.com/xjqqs.jpg

**appearance:** deep copper-ish. decent body. i like the attempt at rebranding, too, bottle-wise—they’ve really simplified the bottle’s look, toned down the ad-copy, and the minimalist design suggests a certain measure of respect for what’s contained inside.

**nose:** here’s the thing—there’s no mistaking this for anything other than a mainstream canadian whisky. you’ve got your vanillas, your butterscotches, your oak, some maple syrup, your general sweetness and mildness. but there’s something more here, too. less assertive than i’d like, but there’s some real flavour, some real spice just lingering on the edge there, a hint of some actual rye wanting to make itself known. baking spices. rye bread. a crisper, fresher oak than you maybe typically see in entry-level canadian whiskies. icing sugar. cloves, dusty rye. cinnamon. orange peel. lemon zest. something floral, perhaps some dark fruits. an earthiness to it. these are flavours that are really disguised at first—in fact, for maybe the first third of the bottle i was *really* disappointed and really thinking “just another big-brand canadian whisky, should have ignored the hype”—but they do start to come out a bit over time, even if perhaps not quite as much as i’d like.

**taste:** much of the same—a canadian whisky through-and-through, but with just a little bit more liveliness and more complexity. nice body, very creamy mouthfeel, with that first blast of caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, maybe maple syrup. but then around the periphery you get something asserting itself that really rounds the flavour out: some rye, some big clove and big, warm cinnamon, maybe a hint of peppermint? oaky, but not the huge oak kick of wiser’s legacy by any stretch—a nice balance, i think, between fresh oak and reused casks. faint citrus tang; gravel (like sucking on pebbles?). but really this is about the canadian whisky sweetness with the cinnamon/spic e bite.

**finish:** medium. somewhat dry. some real cinnamon and cloves, some caramel/vanilla sweetness. toasted oak. really a repetition of the palate here.

**final thoughts:** again, it’s all about managing expectations here. this is one of the best canadian whiskies you’re going to find for under $35 (save maybe alberta premium dark horse), but if you’re judging this by the metric of the ultra-premium wiser’s legacy, you’re going to have a bad time. it’s indeed “bold” and “spicy,” but really only in a relative sense: in comparison to your typical crown royals, canadian clubs, and wiser’s other standard offerings (the special blend and the deluxe)—and while still being, simultaneously, a smooth, fairly soft and sweet canadian whisky through-and-through. it develops when you give it time, and wiser’s deserves credit for even gesturing toward something bigger here (not to mention for upping the abv in a very un-canadian whisky way), but doesn’t go quite as far as i’d like it to go. i suspect i’d like this more on its own merits if i hadn’t tried the wiser’s legacy first, but for what it accomplishes on its own, i really can’t be too judgmental. if you already like canadian whisky as a style, at any rate, it’s definitely something worth trying. if you’re on the fence about canadian whisky, it’s maybe also worth trying, as an example of how companies *are* trying to take the typical canadian whisky profile (smooth, soft, sweet, mixable or sippable) and breathe just a little life—a little edge—into it without leaving behind what people like about it. 

**score:**  81
