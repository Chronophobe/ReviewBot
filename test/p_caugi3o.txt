my continuing drive to try and review all of the forty creek whiskies (save for the whisky cream) continues with **forty creek copper pot reserve**. they just keep making some great stuff, bucking a lot of unpleasing canuck whisky trends, and generally are nice people *(ed. note: i don't think you can say that as you don't know for sure)*.

that being said, given that heart of gold was just released, i'm hoping they don't go full bruichladdich on us.

the **forty creek copper pot reserve** sits (price and quality wise) between the barrel select and the double barrel reserve. let's see if it's well worth the (low) price.

**price:** $28.45 (cad)

**region:** ontario, canada

**abv:** 43%

**colour:** chocolate

**nose:** currant, nutmeg, plums, maple, cinnamon, pear, caramel, pepper, clean linen, vanilla

there's some things hear to remind you this is a canadian (maple). however it has one of the nicer noses that i've had of forty creek, and they are starting to dance in that faint glenfiddich area. it's nice.

**taste:** gravel, caramel, pepper, chocolate, maple, sour fruit, sugared cranberries, cherry, cloves, vanilla, butter

this is quite sour. almost too much. the sourness plays off the earthiness and the sweetness. it calms down after a long time, and generally mellows out, however some people may find it a little overpowering.

the taste reminds me of a few bourbons i've had.

**finish:** bitter, orange juice, cranberry juice, earth, metallic, sea salt

and the last part reminds me of irish. that may be a put off for some people, however it could just be the metallic parts to it. there's something good to start here, and i was quite pleased with this.

**conclusion:** if an irishman moved to the us to make a slightly port aged bourbon, this would be the first result. i'm somewhat torn on this one. i find it good for the price, and i'd serve/swap anyone a nice dram without regret or fear of anger, yet there are some misses that i can't excuse (maple in the nose, unbalanced taste, metallic finish). 

all in all, you can't go wrong with forty creek, and the copper pot is an upgrade from the barrel select

**75/100**
