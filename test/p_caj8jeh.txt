what we have here today is the royal canadian small batch whisky from our friends at sazerac. there's no indication what distilleries it's from, but if i had to guess: alberta distillers and wiser's seem to have had a baby and this bottle is it.

the sazerac website doesn't go into too much detail, apart from the usual glowing in-house reviews, but they have a press kit that gives some surprisingly informative material. 

from sazerac:  
1. 140 million litres of canadian whisky is sold in the us, which is 11.5% of the us spirits market.  
2. sazerac owns more than 270 000 barrels, which is a considerable surprise to me.  
3. this royal canadian bottling is supposedly "less than 50 barrels" to each 'small batch', but i would like a better explanation than is offered on their website.  
4. this bottling is a blend of 4 grains, which is fairly typical. rye, barley, corn and some wheat.  

40% abv, with a dash of water. left to sit for ~10 minutes (a habit of mine).

**colour**: copper. not dark brown, much lighter in the glass than in the bottle. the bottle has a burgundy label on the back which deceptively makes the whisky look very dark. there are some notable legs in the glass even though this is a no age statement bottle. very promising...

**nose**: citrus, very sweet. once again, this canadian is all about vanilla, toffee and caramel. thankfully i'm no raving peat-head so this is right up my alley. there's hot rye in the background but it's not the main occasion. not painfully sweet on the nose like candy, it's more like a glenlivet's citrus and apple-like sweetness. quite pleasant.

**taste**: i expected things to be simpler and with a dominant alcohol heat but it's not here. this is a to-the-point bottle where rye and vanilla are the biggest shows in town. the sweetness from the nose is still here (it is canadian and a blend, after all) and it reminds me of a good, well-made ginger ale. spicy and sweet at the same time - but not obnoxiously so. the sazerac website says it's nutty and i sort of agree, but i'll be damned if i could actually define what i'm tasting.

**finish**: the finish is almost entirely spice and warmth but not pure heat like a danfield's or 100% rye. it's gentle and lasts for a surprisingly long time. no lingering alcohol whatsoever. this would be fantastic in winter. until then, all i can do is crank up the air conditioner and enjoy.

**conclusion**: i really like this whisky. i was afraid it was some sort of attempt by sazerac to get rid of some barrels and make a few quick bucks, but it's a lot more subtle and there's more to discover than the simplistic label lets on. there are canadian whiskies that i would recommend to new people but this one might be more for the snobs like myself to experience and hoard. there's nothing that stands out from the crowd or really defines a niche, other than this bottle's subtlety and really reliable flavour. this could become a 'default' flavour profile if i was ever asked to define what the hell canadian whisky should taste like.

dear distillers/blenders: please try and venture out of your 40% alcohol comfort zone. i think you'll find that the risk is nothing compared to the potential flavours that your customers could find. this bottle could really stand out at 46% or 50% (like so many other canadian blends could).

**86/100**

some day i'll put up my stalk and barrel review... these reviews come out on a total whim at seemingly random intervals.
