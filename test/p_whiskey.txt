As per popular request, I'm posting a quick review of Maker's 46.

Maker's 46 Bourbon Whiskey 94 Proof (46% Alc/vol)

The Visual Inspection: In reference to this chart [1] The whiskey is a dark caramel color, between a 1.6 and 1.7. When swirled, it produces thin, yet slow moving tears.

The Nosing: Nosing Chart [2] On the initial smell, it has a winey/nutty aroma to it. Additional smelling reveals a vanilla/woody smell. After letting the whiskey sit for awhile and breath, a strong caramel and oaky aroma arise. The whiskey tingles the nostrils, but not a large burning sensation.

The Taste: If you have tasted the original Maker's Mark, you would immediately recognize that this is the same family. Maker's 46 has a more complex flavor to it than Maker's Mark does. It starts out with a strong oaky flavor and stays smooth with caramel overtones. The aftertaste is a quite pleasant caramel flavor.

I give it an 8/10 and highly recommend a try for those who like bourbon. It may be a bit too sweet for those who like Rye and other dry whiskeys. I hope you find this useful, it's my first review.

Also, I used this page[3] for help with the review. It's quite helpful.edit to add this link
