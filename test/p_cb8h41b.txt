thanks to biomortis for the jameson/jaime image. i showed him my version earlier today and he said, "that's shit! i can make a better one in 5 minutes! something clean overlay, something something white balance..." 

he also shot [this.](http://i.imgur.com/ddgdh8l.jpg) i like the  ~~bukkake~~ bokeh.

**jaime the kingslayer, 40% abv**

* nose: resinous pine. slightly metallic. leafy, grassy and minty. subtle ashy smoke. sour green apple and under ripe pineapple. raw nuts. sweet floral perfume mixed with acetone.

* taste: decent mouthfeel for 40%, not too watery. tart apples and grapefruit. sharp cereal and grassy notes. grainy ethanol. floral sweetness. diluted vanilla essence.  peppery and oaky towards the finish.

* finish: sweetened wheatgrass juice. short and not bad.

cheap and boring. i paired this whisky with a saint luis rey pacificos (light-medium bodied cigar) and they went well together. probably because jameson is so inoffensive and bland. 

i bought a bottle specifically for this community review and i don't see myself ever buying it again. tastes like flowers and grass. would happily drink if it's free.

&gt;**69/100**
