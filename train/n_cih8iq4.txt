my boss's father passed away recently, and he found these old bottles of bourbon in his closet.  never heard of them, but according to the labels, they're both 86 proof.  pete's penny was aged 4 years, charcoal filtered, and bottled in california.  park and tilford barely has any info, but it was bottled in louisville and aged 6 years.  i'm guessing the bottles are from around 1979, since there was also a bottle of canadian club that was dated in 1979.  

do you think they're safe to drink?  it looks like the park and tilford evaporated slightly, so i think it isn't sealed all the way.
