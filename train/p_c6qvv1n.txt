good evening(day/night/morning) world whisky, i am pleased to present to you a wonderful non-scottish single malt. i originally bought the amrut fusion to rebel against the fact that getting the yamazaki 12 in ontario was challenging (read costly) and i was unable to participate in the scotchit community review. however, after having a few drams i realized that i was unable to wait any longer. the pleasure of drinking amrut fusion must be shared with everyone. without further ado the **amrut fusion**:  

**colour:** golden hay  
**nose:** hint of smoke on the first sniff with some malt, then progressing into a sweet mix of chocolate and fruits. after letting it sit for 20 or so minutes it reminded me of a banana smoothie i had earlier in the day.  
**palate:** sea salt on the tip of the tongue on small sips. had some very nice spice at the top but was not overly complex. with a swish of the mouth in the next sip came a sweetness like honey with a bitter mellowness like dark chocolate (not too dark) acting to balance the flavours.  
**finish:** holy moly did this have a finish. had a very nice spiciness that went on more than the energizer bunny, unlike past long finishers i didn't feel like i swallowed some swamp nor had the camp-fire smoke blow in my direction.   

in the past i would have been concerned with non-scotch single malts, but after tasting some of the japanese singles and the amrut, i definitely believe that style of thinking is very outdated. from the first taste i knew this single malt was a wonderful buy that both kept some of the traditional flavours of scotch while adding in its own style. they call it a fusion for a reason and for that it gets a solid **94**.
