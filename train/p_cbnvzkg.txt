* **color:** bright gold.

* **palate:** full-bodied and earthy. burnt sugar. a touch of anise. 
* **finish:** pretty short. dry. warm, gentle peat smoke with just a hint of pepper.

score: 81/100

it's ok. not mind-blowing.  i was expecting to be overpowered by smoke but i think they found a good balance. i don't think i would be able to identify this as an irish whiskey in a blind tasting. obviously the peat is unusual but it's also double distilled instead of triple, which i'm guessing gives it a bit more character than most irish whiskies. 

i'm pretty sure i bought a bottle years ago but i don't really remember it. i doubt i'd do it again, but i wouldn't turn it down if somebody offered.

edit: as i was archiving i noticed that this was my 100th whisk(e)y review. good for me.
