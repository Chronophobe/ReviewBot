hmm... if they were all the same price on the self, i'd probably go jjb-sb, ceht-sb, ceht-smb, and bb-smb. i might swap the top two or swap the bottom two depending on my mood. they're all nice bottles, i think. it should also be noted that the ceht are bt #1 mash and bowmans are #2, so they all share similarities. 

with price... i would go jjb-sb, ceht-smb, bb-smb, and ceht-sb.
