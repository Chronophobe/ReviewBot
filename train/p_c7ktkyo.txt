st george is a california-based company which produces single malt american whisky, among other tipples. i think this may the first single malt american whisky that i've reviewed. well, i did review the mckenzie pure pot still whiskies from finger lakes distillery, but being pure pot still, that had a mix of malted and unmalted barley in the mix. that should make this dram good fun!

**st george lot 6**

**color:** amber -2 (looks like ardbeg 10)

**abv:** 43%

**aroma neat:**

gin/aromatic botanicals(juniper, peppermint), floral vanilla, pepper corn (slightly), rubber/tires, toasted barley,/hot porridge, honeyed oak, malted milk/cocoa.

very unique nose. there is certainly new-make evident, but what deliciously eccentric new-make!

**aroma water:**

bready vanilla, honey, juniper, root beer/sassafras, ginger beer, toasted oak, sandalwood, spearmint, cocoa, rubber, light tar/chewing tobacco (faintly), screwdriver (vodka and oj).

doesn't change too much with water, still very aromatic

**taste neat:**

spice-infused vanilla, light honey, bitter oak (but not powerful), peppermint, sandalwood, anise, juniper, cloves, orange potpourri, pine tar.   

like the nose, the palate is spicy and aromatic in way that is difficult for me to describe or reconcile with other whiskies i've had. the total effect comes off a bit like aged gin, quite interesting.

**taste water:**

bitter apples (slight cider), peppery orange peels, anise, vanilla, cola, a&amp;w root beer, ginger tea, lemon (slightly), aromatic oak, juniper, pine needles/tar (slightly).  

bizarre and beguiling, but very enjoyable and fun to try to tease apart.

**finish:**

orange potpourri, juniper/gin, marzipan, black liquorice, light barrel char. 

this whisky is an original every turn and this finish is no exception. the bulk of the finish fades somewhat quickly, but an anise and sweet almond character lingers. never thought i'd have a whisky quite like this.

**conclusion:**

interesting nose that lets you know this whisky marches to its own beat.

palate that is similar to the nose, but more expressive in its uniqueness.

finish that is much like the palate (the whole whisky is very coordinated), but with some more barrel influence noticeable.

**rating:** 85/100

this is a rather bewildering whisky, since it is so different. that alone makes it worth trying, in my book. somehow, st george actually is a fairly "easy" whisky to enjoy casually. the the bizarre menagerie of flavors and aromas presenting themselves as an enjoyable and novel curiosity, rather than an impenetrable, unintelligible, or alien experience. certainly this is whisky to approach with an open mind. i believe that if you can do that, then this malt will reward you.

i'm very interested in seeing how this whisky handles itself after further maturation.
