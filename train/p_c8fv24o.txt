i got some from a swap with uncletobys. it's made with barley from scotland and india, hence the name. it's familiar yet different. a bit sweeter than i like but not overwhelming. i didn't like it quite as much as baronscarpia - it's nice but a sample was enough to satisfy my curiosity. 

i took some pleasure in the realization that i was sitting in north america drinking whisky from asia made with barley from europe sent to me from australia. anyone in south america or africa reading this?
