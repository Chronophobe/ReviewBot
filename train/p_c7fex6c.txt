**greenore 8 year old irish grain whisky, 40% abv**

so here we are with a mom sample i picked up in the uk. i am a bit of a fan of grain whiskies, but they are hard to come by and this is my only irish grain whisky to date.

according to their website, the grain used is mostly corn, which is reflected in the tasting notes below:

**nose:** browned butter, toasted popcorn, sweet corn. bubblegum. alcohol shows through.

**palate:** bright, clean, metallic grain. more corn sweetness in the middle. an almost soju-like alcohol sweetness at the end.

**finish:** sweet alcohol with a touch of grain.

**overall:** not that complex or enjoyable, truth be told. alcohol seems to be the overriding flavour here, even at a mere 40%. 

**it's an unfortunate c. i don't think i would be missing anything if i hadn't tried this one.**
