to start off, i'm a pretty big penderyn fan. i had my first sip at a trade show several years ago and loved the original expression. since then, i've been somewhat disillusioned at the newer offerings, finding the original 'penderyn 41' somewhat lacking in depth and flavour complexity. frankly, the cynic in me can't help thinking the '41' range was a way of meeting increased demand with a lack of supply, as the 41 is bottled at 41 proof, rather than the 45 (i think) of the original expression. nonetheless, as a lover of port finishes on whisky, i was pretty excited to see the portwood 41 come to my local liquor store. here are my thoughts. 

**colour:** copper, with perhaps hints of peach in the glass

**nose:** candied pineapple, dried apricots, and a touch of caramel. 

**flavour:** sweet dried fruits (apricots again) right off the bat, going into a slightly dark-chocolate bitterness. a touch flat and bitter in the middle, but with a beautiful, sweet penderyn-trademark finish. a bit too much alcohol heat for me at the end. probably a good one to add a drop or two of water to. 

**score:** 86/100, but again, i'm pretty keen on both penderyn and port-finished whisky.
