this is a special release from forty creek.  their second port wood whisky.  sadly, i never tasted the first version from 2009.  this one was just released in september 2012, with a total of 6,600 bottles available.

this whisky begins with a regular forty creek whisky, which is then aged in heavily charred oak barrels previously used for port.

abv: 45%

cost: $69.95 cdn

colour: deep amber

nose:  there is a lot going on here ... this whisky is complex and the nose is layered.  i spent a lot of time before it touched my lips.  overall, there is a dark fruitiness of figs and prunes, along with deep citrus fruits and cherry notes.  the port obviously shines through, but there is a honey sweetness to the nose also.there's some smoke here too ... not a typical scotch peaty smoke, something different ... hard to explain.

palate:  robust, but very smooth.  starts off surprisingly sweet, then puts forth a steadily-growing peppery blast.  strong notes of deep, dark (almost bitter) chocolate, and a spicey fruit flavour of dried christmas cake fruits intertwined with a dry red wine / port blend.

finish: very long.  pipe tobacco and citrus fruit, with a peppery tingle that goes on forever.

taste: 70/75

value: 12/15

uniqueness: 4/5

would buy again: 4/5 (definitely)

total: 90/100

overall impression:  this is a canadian whisky that demonstrates where we should be heading.  this is no boring, mild, easily-drinkable, smooth offering.  it's complex and layered, and offers a peppery kick in the mouth.  kudos to forty creek for stepping outside of the canadian rye comfort zone with this one.  despite the relatively high price (by canadian whisky standards) i'll be heading back to pick up another bottle to put in storage.  lovely!
