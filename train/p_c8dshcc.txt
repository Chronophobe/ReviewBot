 thanks to uncletobys for this sample!

*[amrut peated cask strength](http://www.spirituosenwelt.at/pic/2287a.jpg). indian single malt, bottled in february 2009 at 62.8% abv. local bottle price: $130 for 700ml.*

**nose:** spicy dried meats; salami and pepperoni. malty vanilla, biscuity sweetness with almond cake and shortbread. when cracked with water, a little rubbery, and also bringing out some light citrus.

**palate:** hot and sharp at 62.8%, and yet, very smooth otherwise. malty vanilla cream, dry oak, toffee, buttery spongecake.

**finish:** sure, it's peaty, but the sweet biscuity character is pulling its weight in the hot, dry finish. again, quite malty, cereal and grainy.

an interesting, complex, balanced single malt that escapes the curse of being too derivative of traditional scotch styles, as some international single malt whiskies tend to be. oh, and it's really, really good.

also, i just found out [this](http://www.amrutwhisky.co.uk/validated/pages/portanova.html) exists. i need it.

**91/100**
