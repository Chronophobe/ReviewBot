also an interesting twist, someone on /r/whiskyporn mentioned the idea of doing a four roses yellow label barrel proof and pointed me to keith boyea who has done some experimentation around that. i reached out to keith and he posted his recipes [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/whiskyporn/comments/257wbx/40_roses/chhpec9?context=3). i'm going to vat those now and review them once i finish the 10 recipes.
