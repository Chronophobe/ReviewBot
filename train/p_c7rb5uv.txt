first go at a review. i'd still qualify myself as a bit of whiskey novice but i've learned a lot over the last year from reading,drinking, and ralfy. i do not recommend adding water to this whiskey as the flavours and scents are easily diluted.

appearance: amber -1

nose: neat - syrupy sweet, maple, vanilla, woody oak

taste: neat - very sweet, almost rye-whiskey-like flavour. slight acidity/sourness apparent when held on sides of tongue

finish: neat: maple detected in scent now tasted, dry, very vodka-like as it is ethanol heavy.

overall: not my favourite, much prefer bushmills 10 for an irish whiskey. it tastes a bit generic to my (admittedly novice) taste buds, which is evidenced by the ethanol heavy finish. it is hard to justify the $20 (canadian) premium over bushmills 10. however, the scent is very pleasant.

73/100
~$60 canadian for 700ml.
