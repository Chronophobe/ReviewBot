i thought this was an interesting read. i live in tennessee and this story has been in constant development over the last few months. 

i don't really see the problem here. for me, it mostly just seems like brown - forman shooting themselves in the foot and hoping to keep control of the hefty market they enjoy here. 

i'm curious to hear what others think.
