**jameson**, 40%, â‚¬40

for labour day in finland (vappu), i picked up a half bottle of jameson, because it was cheaper than many scotch blends, and quite enjoyed it, so i thought it was worthy of a review.

**color**: whisky

**nose**: green apples, malt, grain alcohol, oak, vanilla

really rather pleasant nose. i was quite surprised at how pleasant this is, considering the price. there's undoubtedly grain alcohol in this, but it hides quite nicely behind the sweet bourbon-y vanilla and apples.

**taste**: apples, sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, mild spice

the apples stick around in the taste, with some bourbon-y vanilla and caramel. the sweet maltiness and grain dominates, but it's really not too bad.

**finish**: medium length, grain alcohol burn, spice, vanilla

pretty familiar finish. a bit of grain alcohol burn, some spice (cinnamon, ginger, that type of thing) and vanilla. a bit grainy, but not unpleasant. 

**conclusion**: honestly, i like this. i like it quite a lot. it's not super complex, not super sweet, not super spicy. but it's nice, from end to end. for the price, you really can't go too far wrong with this, and it beats out a ton of similarly-priced blends. i've had some irish whiskeys, but this is really rather nice.

**score**: 82/100
