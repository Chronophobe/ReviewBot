i established a good relationship with the lincoln park location over the past few years, they'll send me stuff that isn't online. (it's just hard to find out when they get something in that they don't put online.)

has e$ opened his bottle yet? if not i'll crack mine and send you a sample. let me peruse your /r/sampleswap inventory to see if we can trade anything else.
