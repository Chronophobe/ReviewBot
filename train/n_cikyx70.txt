thanks.

i'm sure you're not alone. at least someone agrees with you at bt cause they bottled up that first batch ;)

i wonder if they got a little aggressive and choose barrels for big and bold characteristics on number 1. then after it got panned, they took a different approach for the second batch? donno.
