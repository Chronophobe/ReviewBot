lot no. 40 canadian whisky was—at one time—something of a legendary canadian whisky. then it disappeared from the shelves. that was about a decade ago.

but the good news is that it’s back. better than good news, in fact. it’s great news.  because—while my experience with canadian whiskies is somewhat more limited than my experience with scotch—the 2012 edition of lot no. 40 is likely the best canadian whisky i’ve yet had the pleasure of trying. [user bravado’s review](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/11z5yd/review_lot_no_40_canadian_whisky/) seemed a bit over-the-top to me in its enthusiasm when i read it last week, but consider me now one of the converted. distilled in a single copper pot still from a mash-bill of 100% rye grain (according to the original lot no. 40 recipe), this stuff is simply outstanding. and at the price point—about $39 cdn. for 750ml in alberta, there legitimately might not be a whisky from any region in the world that compares.

lot no. 40 canadian whisky 2012 release; nas; $39; bottled at 43% abv (which is nice to see in a canadian whisky, since they’re generally so hard-line about adhering to the 40% mark); presumably chill-filtered and caramel coloured (but hey, you can’t win them all); produced by corby distilleries (who also make wiser’s and are affiliated with pernod ricard)

**appearance:**  most likely caramel colour here all the way, but great legs. not that it matters with regard to the whisky itself, but i also *love* the packaging—the old-time bottle with etched glass and the stamped paper label affixed at an odd angle is a nice touch.

**nose:** heavenly. no sign of the alcoholic singe of a lot of standard canadian whiskies, even at 43% abv. and the standard oaky vanillas and maples are there, but in a radically different presentation than the cloying synthetic sweetness of wiser’s or cc. instead, the vanilla is beautifully integrated with the rye (it’s a creamy vanilla-butterscotch ice cream, almost, and it’s *magical*), and the maple-toffee sweetness lurks ever so quietly in the back. oak. the rye is the big seller here, though. sweet rye, sour rye, spicy rye, floral rye. waves of a fresh bakery. hay. grass. waves of christmas spices—cinnamon, especially. big cinnamon. ginger? nutmeg? cloves? homemade candies. brown sugar. fruits—raisins? but also some fresh fruit. apples? pears? it’s tempting to not even take a sip. a couple drops of water and that butterscotch-vanilla nose just explodes out of the glass. absolutely brilliant stuff.

**taste:** moderate mouthfeel; the spicy rye really jumps at you—there’s a peppery quality—but almost no alcohol burn. christmas spices (again, cinnamon), light oak, vanilla and butterscotch. again, like fresh rye baking in a bakery—sweet and sour and unbelievably evocative. fresh and dark fruits. grassy fields and hay. candies. a few drops of water mellow things out a bit, showcasing the beautiful integration of the rye and the vanilla.

**finish:** unrivalled in canadian whiskies. warm and bready, peppery, and that vanilla and those christmas spices linger. oak. cloves. earthy—grass and farm-field. warms your belly. makes you feel at home. reminds me of christmas eve with the family.

**final thoughts:** wow. just wow. i can’t compare this to the original lot no. 40, because it came well before my time, but this stuff holds its own by any metric i can conceive of. if you’ve never thought of yourself as a fan of canadian whisky, i would suggest this as the bottle to change your mind. there is nothing not to love here. the nose alone is worth (more than) the price of admission. i just cannot say enough good things about this whisky.

**score:**  91/100
