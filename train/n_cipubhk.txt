yeah, we were aware of that. we did notice the drams they give out are very hard to call generous. glenmorangie for example was much nicer. but still, the free access was helpful because it gave us a general layout for a route to take. i think we'll be visiting more "alternative" distilleries next time we go. bruichladdich being one of them probably as islay is on our radar.

i think the quality of the tour really depends on the person and time of day. we were excited about dalwhinnie for example, but the guide just wasn't into it and the machines were really loud at that time so it was hard for him to speak and hard for us to hear him.

also, don't use their flavour map, it doesn't make sense. well it does, but only "sorta". or maybe i need more practise.
