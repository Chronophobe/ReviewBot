gibson’s sterling has an interesting pedigree. it’s currently the entry level whisky in the gibson’s portfolio, but once upon a time, that wasn’t so. back in the day, gibson’s 12 year old was the brand’s flagship, until extreme shortages of appropriately aged whiskies in the gibson warehouse led to a dilemma in the late 1980s: drop the age statement and reformulate the gibson’s recipe, or limit supply until the warehouse stock catches up with demand. the company, interestingly, did both (sort of): severely limiting the availability of the 12 year old, but replacing it (until stocks could be replenished) with a new, roughly equivalent product as a stopgap.

enter gibson’s sterling, which, though absent an age statement, actually originally contained whiskies as old as 25 years (though obviously also some much younger ones) in a blend that attempted to appease the hardcore gibson’s drinkers who missed their 12. apparently it worked, because the stopgap measure became a permanent staple for the company—though obviously it’s been reformulated, and you’ll no more find those 25 year old whiskies in the recipe. still, a cool story, all-in-all (that comes courtesy of davin at [canadianwhisky.org](http://www.canadianwhisky.org/)).

having tried ([and reviewed](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1cwc3t/review_gibsons_finest_aged_12_years/)) the gibson’s 12 myself for the first time only recently, i figured it was maybe also worth trying the younger brother of the family, so i picked up a mini-bottle of the sterling to give it a go. to help with the comparison, i also poured a small glass of the gibson’s 12 year old—the remnants of a mini-bottle of that one—in order to do a side-by-side comparison.

**gibson’s finest sterling canadian whisky**; no age statement; 40% abv; this particular sample comes from a 50ml mini bottle, but a 750ml bottle runs about $27 cdn. in the province of alberta

**appearance:** virtually identical in colour to its older brother—on the light side of amber, perhaps old gold—which i would venture to guess is a sign of caramel colouring to even things out.

**nose:** more assertive than the 12 year old, with less creamy, vanilla, sweet notes immediately coming out. a bit more prickly, spicier on the nose (more rye, more sense of the ingredients—i definitely get some corn), but still a pretty typical canadian whisky nose. pancake syrup, toasted oak. citrus (lemon?). berries? the creamy vanilla does come out a bit over time, but there’s definitely some youth. again that kind of chlorinated or hard water nose i got from the 12; something plastic. nose isn’t as nice as the 12 year old (which isn’t exactly the apex of canadian whiskies itself), but it’s not nearly as much worse as i was expecting, and there’s a bit of zest or kick that’s appealing, if that’s your thing. packs more punch than the 12, at any rate, if not any nicer or fundamentally different flavours (though in the grand scheme of cheap canadian whiskies, it’s still fairly smooth and restrained, i would say).

**taste:** syrupy mouthfeel. a bit hotter on the mouth than the 12 year old, but fundamentally not dissimilar—that creaminess is there for certain, and some berry sweetness. brown sugar. caramel, barley sugar. maple syrup in a much bigger dose than with the 12, but also some interesting about the soft, sweet creaminess with the kick of rye and the markers of a younger whisky. still, all in all it’s quite sweet, and not very balanced at all.  in fact, i’m shocked that gibson’s found it necessary to come out with a maple syrup-finished whisky, because this stuff *really* has that maple syrup note in spades. the more it sits, the more pronounced the syrup becomes, too.  maybe one of the sweetest canadian whiskies i’ve encountered, which is saying something. i’m not sure i’d say i prefer it over the 12, but it’s honestly not without its charms if you like your whisky *very* sweet and very much made in the canadian style. . . .

**finish:** . . . except then it all falls apart. medium length and strange. bitter, bitter wood, some faint sweet and sour fruits, and citrus. did i mention the bitterness? really not so nice; if the 12 and the sterling are demonstrably different, it’s here, and it’s not pleasant.

**final thoughts:**  finish aside, i’m actually somewhat impressed by the gibson’s sterling—not really as a whisky on its own merits (because it’s still pretty mediocre, as the vast majority of entry-level whiskies of *all* types tend to be), but at least in terms of competing with its older brother, it really does succeed. it’s also, i think, better than some of the entry-level canadian whiskies it’s competing with: canadian club classic, wiser’s special blend, and even wiser’s deluxe. but boy is it sweet and boy does that finish really kill anything it has going for it.

**score:** 75
