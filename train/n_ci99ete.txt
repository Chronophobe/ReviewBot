the quinta ruben is definitely the most different to the original out of those two. it's finished in port which i'm a particular fan of and is significantly stronger too. the nectar d'or is done in sauternes casks and i thought it carried a bit more sweetness than the original, but not much else - at 
least not that i could discern. it's been a while since i've sampled that one though so i might be able to pick out more characteristics now having tried a lager range.
