**background**

when i reviewed elijah craig 12 barrel proof (3rd batch) i gave it my top rating. i liked it so much i got curious how to make more of it by blending it with the regular elijah craig 12. i’m a fan of  unfiltered barrel proof bourbons. there’s so much flavor and i like choosing my own adventure with how much water to add. i try to check myself against liking big bourbons just because they’re big, but like a good iipa, there’s just something inherently great about going big. so, my ratings tend to favor things like elijah craig 12 barrel proof. plus ecbp is a great value on an age stated bottle and that too me puts it over the top.

since i wrote that review a few months ago two additional batches have been released. the whole menu of elijah craig 12 barrel proof  includes:

* batch 1 – 67.1% / 134.2-proof
* batch 2 – 68.5% / 137.0-proof
* batch 3 – 66.6% / 133.2-proof
* batch 4 – 66.2% / 132.4-proof
* batch 5 – 67.4% / 134.8-proof

since that review, i’ve picked up the fourth and fifth batch and i’ve been curious how they stack up. sampling three barrel proof glasses is a test of endurance, but it must be done. you can’t really spend a lot of time evaluating these before your sensors go comfortably numb. it’s a challenge, while a fun one, but that’s a big caveat here on results.

**process**

i ran through these at full proof. then added water and took a break before revisiting. then came back around the next day again at barrel proof. as with all barrel proof bottles, i prefer some water with elijah craig 12 barrel proof. still, sampling at bottle strength i think gives a good impression of what we’re dealing with. after that, adding water i think helps represent how i’d typically enjoy it.

**results**

well this was fun. these are all pretty great.

3rd release: sweeter, i get more caramel and vanilla than the others
4th release: more astringency and nice caramel coming through. a bit more bite.
5th release: char seems a bit more assertive. a little smokey. some cocoa.
to me #3 and #4 are both about equal. i prefer #4 slightly as it has a bit more character, although #3 might be a little easier drinking. i’d have no problem buying an extra bottle of either of these for the bunker.

**closing**

so, there you go. these are all worth picking up if you see a bottle. if i find a batch 4, i’ll be more likely to buy a bottle i don’t need, but in no way are any of these a notch below the others. my line up here would be #4, #3, and #5.

fun fact: after i did testing on this, i poured the three glasses together. yeah, that’s good too!
