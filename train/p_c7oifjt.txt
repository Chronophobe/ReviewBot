hello ww, texacer here with another quick review from mooselandia.  i have had **crown royal black 90 proof** before at a bowling alley but that is hardly a place to review.  i remember i enjoyed it so here goes: 


* color: brown
* nose: light vanilla/caramel. licorice. 
* taste: good sweet spiced.  roasted brown sugar almonds.  cinnamon.  molasses. 
* finish: medium 

very decent.  i can see why this one is available more than the previous ones i've reviewed here.  this could be the one i pick up but we'll see when i get past the 40 creeks next month.  

&gt;85/100
