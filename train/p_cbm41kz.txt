**hellyers road peated, 46.2% abv**

*peated tasmanian single malt*

* nose: horseradish. a weird sweet metallic note. sauerkraut. fresh yeasty dough. faint floral peat. freshly mown grass and pine needles. almond oil and oregano.

* taste: light-medium bodied. tart and tangy on the palate. starchy. lemon and lime. sour prunes. earthy peat. diluted honey and apple vinegar. raw almonds. pepper and wasabi. floral notes in the background.

* finish: vegetal and earthy peat smoke. lots of cardamom. green tea. weird sweet metallic notes from the nose return. medium length with lingering sour grassy/piny notes.

this whisky is really weird. unlike any peated  world whisky or scotch i've ever had. quite sour, but not unpleasant. 

i enjoyed it, but i can see how some people might hate it.

&gt;**80/100**
