well, i just left a liquor store and bought a bottle of airigh nam beist and this uigedail was next to it. i had a look at the bottle and saw the label was different than the uigedail bottle i already have (and am running low on...), so i picked it up as well. since the label is different, i'm wondering how old the bottle i have is just for my own knowledge.
