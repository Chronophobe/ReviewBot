luckily shipping from binny's is about the same as 11% tax if you're in the city, so i can order stuff and it's not crazily expensive. i am trying to stick to my freeze, though. it doesn't apply to dusties, at least i decided that when i came upon an ewsb 1999 for $25 yesterday. denver might not be a whisky town but there are things available here that i haven't seen in ages. weller 12 is not among them, unfortunately.

edit: why are you awake?
