hey ww,

this is my review of the **mystery spirit** from my secret santa *leroideschoux*. the only info i got is that this isn't scotch and that it's bottled from a single cask. so let's see what we got here:

* colour: dark amber

* nose: vanilla, sweet caramel, aromatic glue / bubble gum, coconut, dark chocolate

* taste: sweet vanilla, hazelnut, licorice, touch of lemon

* finish: coal, pepper, bitter oak, more vanilla, medium long

&gt; 78/100

nose and taste are pleasant, but the finish is a bit harsh and i find it a little unbalanced. that's why i deducted a few points. it certainly benefits from a drop of water. if i'm not mistaken this isn't bottled at cask strength and due to the dominant vanilla, i assume it was matured in fresh oak barrels. could be bourbon, could be something else. i am not very experienced with different world whiskys, so i don't have a point of reference.

leroideschoux, enlighten me, what is it?
