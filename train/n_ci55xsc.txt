well, let's start with the jw. i bought it when i was a youngn in the world of whisky. i don't really like it. 

the laphroaig is something i do like,  but need to be in a specific mood to enjoy, due to it's intense peaty flavour. 

i haven't had the glenfiddich yet. 

the glenlivet was my first single malt and it will always hold a special place in my heart, both for sentimental reasons, as well as deliciosness. 

the macallan is probably my favourite after work scotch.
