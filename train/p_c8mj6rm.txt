**glen breton rare 10, 43% abv, 50ml sample**

*canadian single malt whisky from the [glenora distillery]( http://www.glenoradistillery.com/)*

* nose: barley sugar, vanilla and honey. sweetened chrysanthemum tea. cereal, grass and green apples. menthol and bit of ethanol harshness.

* taste: very light and thin. there is a cooling sensation similar to mouthwash. spearmint sweets. mint thins. creme de menthe minus the sweetness. lemon juice and pepper. grass, pine and aloe. menthol cigarettes. dry and minty. 

* finish: dettol, ethanol and grain. burnt coffee. short and harsh.

this is my first canadian whisky (i had some candian club when i was younger but that doesn't count) and it's errrm... very unique! the nose is nice but it tastes like diluted mint flavoured mouthwash. the finish is shit.

drinkable neat, but i'd rather not.

&gt;**54/100**
