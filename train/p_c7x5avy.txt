forty creek barrel select

going back to back with canadians, this one being from forty creek.  i don't know much about them and haven't had anything from them so this should be fun.

the bottle states the whisky is aged in barrels with various levels of char, ranging from light to heavy, but the color seems too dark for that, so i am guessing it has a touch of caramel color added.  the nose is pretty soft and muted with just a touch of vanilla and grain.  easy drinking on the palate, nothing jumps out, a little fruit sweetness towards the end.  finish is quick with a light sweetness and a little bit of char.

forty creek is not terrible, but it doesn't have much going on either.  it fits the easy drinking, smooth, and slightly sweet canadian whiskey profile.  i'm sure it's fine for mixing, and would be at home in any flask. **75/100**

i should note, it looks like i drank the entire 50ml bottle while reviewing, so it seems i like it.
