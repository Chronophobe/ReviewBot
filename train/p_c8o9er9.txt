**[kweichow moutai, 53% abv]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maotai)**

*chinese fermented [sorghum]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorghum) spirit*

* nose: the sweetest and most fragrant sorghum. chrysanthemums and water lilies. i'm also getting some citric tartness that balances the sweet floral notes beautifully. this is absolutely unbelievable; nosing this is like being whisked off to china and being dropped in the middle of a sorghum field during the springtime. sure, the farmers are a little startled at your presence, but you are in heaven. you nod at them with a greeting... "sup?" they look confused. you smile blissfully. 

* taste: mouth coating warmness. creamy black rice pudding with a dollop of coconut cream. sweet molasses with a hint of szechuan pepper. incredibly smooth but i'm also getting hot tanginess... is that galangal? rice vinegar, star anise, coriander seeds and sweet basil. deeply rich and intoxicating. complex and balanced. 

* finish: an explosion of umami goodness. sweet soy sauce. rice cakes and rock sugar. winter melon and lemongrass. sweet new year candy with a sprinkling of himalayan salt. the perfect marriage of sweet and savoury. long, effervescent, and moreish. 

yes, mere mortals may see this as just a fermented sorghum spirit, but it also *has* spirit - it possesses soul, character and vitality. moutai is not your average alcoholic beverage, it delivers a transcendent experience that takes you places you never thought possible. 

we came out of the cave, looked over the hill and saw fire. we crossed the ocean, and we took to the sky. drinking this will make you look towards the heavens and reach for the stars. 

i feel guilty giving this an arbitrary numerical score, so instead i will rate it:
