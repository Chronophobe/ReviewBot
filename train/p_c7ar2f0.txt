tenth (community reviews not included) review! and for this, i chose to review jack daniel's single barrel. it's my first non-scotch whisky review. it's obviously very different from scotch, but after the initial shock i think i've got use to it, and it's not at all unpleasant. it's bottled at 45% and comes from a single "hand-selected" barrel. colour: [amber](http://i.imgur.com/x81ff.jpg)


* **nose:** vanilla, paint, pepper, curry spice, toffee, coconut

* **taste:** burnt sweet, caramel, almond, burnt hazelnut, glue? it's refreshing. 

* **finish:** slightly bitter aftertaste, but it continues on from the initial feeling. i want more, but i'm not sure if it's because i really enjoy it, or because i want the taste to replace the finish. then again, i like it. 

i have mixed feelings about this one. it's a love and hate relationship, and although i'm not a huge fan of that glue aspect in the taste, it's not like i couldn't drink it again. it's not a scotch, and i suppose that's where the main difference lies. i still appreciate it and it was my drink of choice tonight, so i'll give it.. 

**75/100**

it's a beautiful bottle and would make for a great gift, with nice [details, like this cork.](http://i.imgur.com/w06eq.jpg)
