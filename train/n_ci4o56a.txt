if you're ever in the baltimore area, check out millstone cellars and prepare to have your mind blown.  what they do with cider is mind changing.  

the ola dubh is great if you have more of (and i hate saying this) an advanced palate. the bitter in the dubh takes away so much for folks that aren't used to it and it pours like motor oil.  this is one of the best "entry" level intros to someone who's a beer fan but wants to drink scotch.
