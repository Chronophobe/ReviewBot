woo! happy st paddy's day everyone! you'll be seeing a lot of other black bush reviews on blogs today. you see, a bunch of us whisky bloggers meet in secret to shape world events and we happened to decided to commemorate st patrick's day by doing synchronized reviews of this popular, sherry matured, irish blend from bushmills. i hope you enjoy this review and the many others now available, some of which there are links to below!

**bushmills black bush**


**color:** amber +0

abv: 40%

**aroma neat:**

hay, malt barley, ground cinnamon, sun-dried raisins, weak tea with honey, stewed apples, nutmeg (slightly), mulled cider, black cherry syrup (in a light way), grist/flour, spicy cloves (oily too), cracked pepper.

i like the nose on this one. the sherry influence is clear, but not overbearing. rather, soft, but sometimes spicy, sherry notes balance well with the light and easy going spirit. mmm, pleasingly fruity too.

**aroma water:**

waxy honey, vanilla, gristy grain (sweet and bitter), spiced apples (some cider), nutmeg, raisins, fruit leather, lightly buttered toast/soda bread, rose water, smyrna figs, plums (slightly).

gets a little too quiet with water. too bad really, the neat nose was quite nice. i know it's "just" a blend, but it's always a shame to bottle quality whisky at 40%. unfortunately it's a shame that makes business sense.

**taste neat:**

vanilla-infused honey, wax, buttery sweet grain, light brown sugar, cinnamon/pepper (slightly), toasted oak/light char.

i can taste the sweetness of the grain whisky in here. that's not a mark against this drink, though, since it tastes like well-matured grain whisky. it's not new-makey or rough, just sweet and slightly vegetal.

**taste water:**

honey in weak tea, waxy vanilla, cinnamon/spiced apples, bosc pears, clove oil, pepper corns, green oak, light char.

similar profile to neat. isn't as affected by water so much as the nose.

**finish:**

pepper, peppermint candies, vanilla, honey, grainy bitterness, rose water, light char.

 medium/short duration, but interesting enough.

**conclusion:**

well-rounded nose that is best enjoyed neat.

light sherry palate that is in appropriate proportion with the also typically light bushmills spirit.

decent finish. perhaps a wee short, but not bad at all for an nas blend at 40%.

**rating:** 83/100

there is a lot going on in this whisky. unfortunately, at 40% it takes diligent effort to find all the little flourishes. i doubt many people will take the time to that, especially on st patrick's day... come on bushmills/diageo, make this whisky a little easier to enjoy and bottle at higher strength. with this whisky, you're doing everything else right!
