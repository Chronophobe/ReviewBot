that's better than having #3-5 come in at an average price of $4800/bottle. i guess it's a list of their top rated whiskies regardless of price but a list that includes $4000+ bottles mixed in with $27 ones seems a bit silly to me.  i'm curious to see their full thoughts in the review issue (they rated 117, it says) - what's the general take on how accurate/useful their reviews are?  close to the mark or not worth paying much attention to?
