hey there ~~weird~~world whisky fans! i don't often review world whisky, despite being in one of those places that produces (some) of it. specifically, we have teerenpeli, a new-ish distillery/brewery/restaurant chain that operates in finland.

this was on offer at the bar i frequent with my colleagues, so i thought i'd try it. this is what i thought.

----

**teerenpeli 10 single barrel**  
*finland, 43% abv, second fill sherry cask*

**colour**: pale, amber-2

**nose**: malted barley, mango, pineapple, wild blueberries, raspberry, vanilla, toasted oak, oak tannins

extremely fruity with a bit of a sour edge. a bit of a challenge to nose since it's so light. my colleagues disliked the nose because of the slight bitter note, but i didn't think it was too bad.

**taste**: light mouthfeel, bitter wood, malt, vanilla, sour apples, strawberries, mango

sweet and sour, with very little noticeable sherry influence. a light and fruity dram, not that much complexity.

**finish**: mild and short, slight bitter oak, sour citrus

a bit too watery, tastes weirdly young for a 10 year old whisky. mainly bitterness after a few sips.

**summary**: a decent, but not that interesting dram. the sherry influence is barely noticeable, you could have told me this was a bourbon cask and i would have believed you. i don't like that they felt the need to dilute a single cask offering to 43%, it just seems miserly.

**score**: 72/100  
*meh.*
