i'm really sorry, i'm still learning reddit and for some reason it doesn't notify you when someone comments on your thread.

the book set is awesome.  book one is the manufacturing/distilling process, differences between different blends and brands, etc.

book 2 details many distilleries, gives ratings on their various bottlings, etc.  for example, it talks about balvenie, and then rates their different offerings. one thing i really like is that they have a section for each which tells you the best bottle to start with if you're new to than brand.  for balvenie, they recommended the balvenie 15 single barrel as the best introduction to that brand. 

the rating system is pretty detailed and goes way beyond just giving a star rating.

in addition to great information, the pictures are beautiful and make me want to drink.

again, i apologize for the tease and no follow-up info.
