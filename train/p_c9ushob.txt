**mackmyra special 02, 50.6% abv**

*swedish single malt whisky*

&gt;located in valbo, just outside g√§vle, some 180km north of stockholm, mackmyra distillery was founded in 1999 by eight friends from the stockholm's institute of technology.

&gt; the second of mackmyra's 'special' series, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the opening of the distillery. it's a mix of ex-bourbon and swedish oak matured whisky.

&gt; cask strength and non-chill filtered.

* nose: floral honey, fresh pears and blood oranges. tart white grapes. lemon curd and vanilla. oak and conifer. very faint wood smoke. some zinc and rock salt.

* taste: sweet and creamy. vanilla custard tart. more ripe citrus. barley sugar. turns peppery and tart. dry oaky tannins and spice. a bit grassy with some savouriness at the end.

* finish: ashy and smoky. dried herbs and sweet liquorice. honey roasted nuts. more oak. medium long and bittersweet.

this is my first bottle of swedish whisky; i picked it up on sale and i'm quite happy with my purchase. i've tried other mackmyra expressions in bars and they have all been enjoyable.

this one is about 6 years old and you can taste the youthfulness. however, it's well crafted, has a bit of complexity despite its age, and it's quite tasty. a lot of oak in this one, but it doesn't overwhelm the spirit and the smokiness was a pleasant surprise. nice dram!

&gt;**85/100**
