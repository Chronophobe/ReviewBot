**nose**
there is a very pleasant burnt sugar / bruleed pastry scent to it, but it’s no one sniff pony. get that second sniff and it’s all grains and conjures images of farm houses and fresh cut hay.

**taste**
here’s where it gets awesome. first there’s a wave of honey with some nutty aspects on the side. next up are some very light and pleasant woody aspects that add some body to this workhorse. then finally we get some smooth tasting grains, almost a wheat like flavor followed up with a salted brown butter aftertaste.

**feel**
it is a bit rough around the edges, but it’s warm going down and it doesn’t make you regret your choice at any time.

overall it's one that's always good to have on hand and at it's price it's definitely afforadable to do so.
