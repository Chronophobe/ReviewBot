hello world whisky...it..  texacer here with a quick review.  this was from a mystery dram i got from bigmoneysalsa.  **mccarthy's oregon single malt pot still whiskey 80 proof**

* color: faint yellow
* nose: tang and smoke.  orange.  pasture straw.  
* taste: muted smoke. buttery peat hay.  oily vanilla.  mild honeyed yams.  
* finish: fast

2nd american single malt that i haven't cared for (different than bourbon of course), i was also not impress with cosairs triple smoke either.  i do get the peat from this one though at least. i'm happy to have tried it because i won't have to buy a bottle.  not terrible, just boring.  it's another 3year old like cosairs as well.  they really need more maturing.

&gt;75/100
