i've had my eye on these angaston bottlings for a while. this was produced by a wine/liquor merchant in the south australian barossa valley wine region. they only distill once every few years or so, then put out a bunch of different limited-release expressions. many thanks to uncletobys for giving me the chance to try this one!

*smith's angaston 12. australian single malt, distilled in 2000, vatting of three french oak casks and one american oak cask. bottled at 43% abv. bottle price: $120 for 700ml.*

**nose:** port wine, sultanas, apricots. thick, malty vanilla. light grapes and apples - as if there's some sort of a brandy counterpoint happening. (oddly enough, apparently this vintage used a specific yeast strain that originated from the cognac region - maybe that's where the brandy association is coming from.)

**palate:** clean, medium-bodied, very fresh flavours of juicy white grapes and lychees. richly sweet barley sugars and hints of rye spice.

**finish:** finish is subtle and very dry, still with more of those delicious white grape flavours, almost like a cool glass of champagne or sav blanc. salted caramel and just the lightest touch of old oak. medium length, could be longer.

well, this was surprising. after nosing, i had this big rant prepared about how this solidifies a commonality among other australian port-matured whiskies, but then on the palate and finish, it threw me a massive curveball with all those white wine notes.

this is a very interesting and rewarding dram, and would easily score up in the mid-90s if only it was bottled at a little higher proofage. 43% simply does not allow this beautiful whisky to reveal its potential. i'll have a keen eye for any cask strength angastons in the future.

**88/100**
