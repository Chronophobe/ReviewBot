in this case, i went solely on instinct. it looked good. looked old. and nothing on it that would be worth counterfeiting. all the details (dates, labeling) checked out. 

the ask was $45. i handed my lady friend $40 and told her to offer $30, take $40. but she's a looker so, $30 it was.

once we got it home the rest of the details check out. henry ruby was a druggist in the area in prohibition times. and seeing as how it wasn't, like, an atlantic city prescription or something, and the bottle is exactly the same as others online (without the script), yeah, i am convinced.

convinced enough to display it in our bar, anyways. alongside our vintage 4r ads, and of course... full bottles. ;)
