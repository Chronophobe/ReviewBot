i can’t remember the last time i tried forty creek’s standard offering, barrel select. that said, my (indistinct) recollection of it was of a fairly typical canadian whisky—a bit spicier, a bit more interesting than your ccs and your crown royals, but still pretty light and thin and in-line with the conventions of canadian whisky (and with a surprisingly intense youthful graininess and alcohol-kick to the face).

it’s for that reason that i didn’t go into forty creek’s copper pot reserve (a fairly new addition to the dstillery’s line-up) with particularly high expectations. but after a day helping out with flood relief here in southern alberta, i needed a stiff drink pretty badly, and picked up a bottle because it was on sale.

john hall, forty creek’s owner and whisky maker, describes this as an “amped up” version of the barrel select, bolder and richer, and bottled at a higher abv. my memories of the barrel select are fuzzy enough that i’m not sure how accurate that statement is, but either way: consider me impressed. maybe it’s the expectations i went in with. maybe it’s the context. who knows. but this stuff has really surprised me. it is a very, very good whisky, particularly at its price point.

**forty creek copper pot reserve canadian whisky**; no age statement; 43% abv (yay!); 750ml; retails for about $28 cdn. (though i picked it up on sale at a slight discount).

**appearance:** quite dark; deep copper, approaching almost an auburn or mahogany. nice legs. matches the colour of the label well—and i admit here that i’m pretty big on the forty creek branding: simple, but distinctive.

**nose:** unbelievably intense and distinct toffee or butterscotch aroma that i just absolutely love, paired with a big undercurrent of cinnamon hearts candy. ginger. clove, nutmeg, all-spice, cinnamon (obviously): there’s some rye here coming out that’s really complementing the usual sweetness of mainstream canadian whisky (and you can tell it’s young rye, but young rye can be very good). that tingling rye spiciness. vanilla, obviously. maple syrup, candied pecans. caramel. toasted oak. a slight fruitiness—dried apricots? raisins or figs? bitter oranges? faint corn character. just a great, great nose.

**taste:** soft, smooth, sweet (and let me emphasize again—yes, this is sweet whisky, make no mistake about that), but that toffee character is paired throughout with again that real nice cinnamon candy kick. and it’s just a delight to drink. white pepper—again, some youth, but it’s welcome as a counterpoint to the typical soft-sweetness of canadian whisky as a style. citrus. vanilla. clove, all-spice. doesn’t quite live up to the promise of the nose, but this is just a preposterously drinkable whisky.

**finish:** perhaps short, but that’s canadian whisky, and what is there is nice, and not over-the-top sweet. toffee. vanilla. oak. pine? dry nuts. bitter oranges. some clove and ginger. lingering rye spice and chili pepper.

**final thoughts:** this is a whisky maker doing something great within the style of whisky that he’s working (and john k. hall is nothing if not acutely aware that he is a *canadian* whisky maker). make no mistake: this is canadian whisky (don’t say i didn’t warn you). it’s quite sweet. it’s smooth. it’s not especially high-rye. it’s within the parameters of the style by any metric i can imagine, and yet there’s something about this one that just absolutely *pops* for me. i have no interest in the vast majority of non high-rye canadian whisky, but that would quickly change if more companies were putting out bottles like this one. and at just an amazing price--$28 may not sound like a steal to an american audience, but once you drop below $30 in canadian liquor stores, your options for palatable whisky start to become few and far between. this is one of them. not a perfect whisky, but damned good.

**score:** 85
