since the auchentoshan i reviewed last happened to be a triple-distilled scotch, i though it would be natural to review another triple-distilled whisky. this time, it's an irish whisky from midleton called green spot. green spot is a single pot still irish whisky, meaning that is was distilled from malted and unmalted barley from only one distillery, in this case midleton. the name green spot came from a practice of bottler mitchell &amp; son, where the age of the whisky would be indicated by a colored blotch of paint. green spot comes with no age statement, but my next review will be it's older brother, the 12 year old yellow spot. i am a big fan of redbreast 12, another single pot still whisky from midleton, so these spots have big shoes to fill!

**green spot**

**color:** amber +0

**abv:** 40%

**aroma neat:**

fresh grain/malted barley, hay, vanilla, baked apples, apricots, cinnamon (slightly)/hot tamales, pie crust, juicy fruit gum, copper (slightly), angel food cake.

light and fresh on the nose. perhaps too light for people accustomed to bourbon or some bigger scotches. demonstrates the good aspects of youth by putting a refined and gently grainy spirit on display, though wholly it's a touch simple.

**aroma water:**

vanilla bean, wild honey, jelly beans, apples, pineapple, pear juice, ground cinnamon, metallic/copper (slightly),  barley mash, toasted oak (very slightly), marshmallow.

sweeter and notably fruitier with water. i was afraid it would drown, but i'd say quality increased. the pot still "signature" is more evident now.

**taste neat:**

sweet grains, raw sugar, oak/wood sugars, golden apples, brown pears, light caramel, black pepper (very slightly), vanilla (very slightly).

punchier than the nose with wood and some associated sweetness supporting grain. well modulated, certainly. i think it has broad appeal.

**taste water:**

wild honey, oak, cinnamon/pepper (slightly), vanilla, light caramel, bitterish grain/spirit, light char/charcoal, golden apples, pears.

woodier and a bit sweeter than neat, with less grain. becomes a bit thin.

**finish:**

barrel char, woody, copper, liquorice (slightly), honey, bitter grain (not too bitter).

short/medium finish which i enjoy while it lasts.

**conclusion:**

light, simple nose which becomes fruitier with water.

delivers the best experience on the palate, with a good mix of wood, grain, and fruit.

enjoyable finish which should last longer.

**rating:** 83/100

green spot is designed to be drinkable and it is. i don't think it's a dram i'll frequently ponder over, but it's a great quick pour. as far as nas statement whiskies go, especially more affordable irish ones, this is a good option.
