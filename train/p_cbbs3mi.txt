**review** : wiser's legacy 45% abv, 50 cad$ 

**colour**: dark gold 

**nose**: spices, sweet maple, fresh sawdust, strong wood, peppermint, bananas, minty.  very refeshing.  

**mouth**: mint, bananas, hot peppers, vanilla, lots of oak, very spicy, maple.  nothing is overpowering, this is exquisitely balanced.  you can literally choose what flavour to focus on and home in on it.  i've never had something that can be broken down this easily. 

**finish**:  copper taste, spices, very long, wood, sweet fruit. 

**conclusion**: i have never been a fan of canadian whisky.  the sweetness is usually out of control and the overabundance of maple simply ruins the whisky.  this, on the other hand, is the craftsmanship i have been looking for from my homeland.  wiser's has been able to tune the maple into the stradivarius of canadian whisky.   

this is a blend of rye and barley.  sadly, i have very limited experience with ryes (hard to find in quebec) but this bottle opened my eyes.  there is a different complexity that is not found in scotch that i very much enjoyed here.  i'm sincerely impressed by this whisky. 

considering that the johnnie walker black is 53$ up here, the wiser's legacy is an absolute bargain at 50$.  i have stocked multiple bottles for the rest of the year. 

**total**: 92/100
