i've seen many boastful party boys eat their words after a visit to happy valley.  it's pretty intense, especially on football weekends.


 my favorite quote is from a playboy party school ranking a few years back.  they had a top 10 list and penn state wasn't on it.  below there was a note:

"we cannot rank penn state university against other schools in the party school category because we feel it is unfair to rank professionals against amateurs" -playboy magazine
