exactly. i didn't mean to imply all indian whisky is crap. still, the clear majority of it isn't actually whisk(e)y according to the definitions the rest of the world would recognize. those two brands are crap because they aren't really whisky, hence the quotes. if some of these guys want to pretend that isn't the case, they are welcome to drink the stuff!

i've paid attention to amrut with great interest, but it more or less proves the point. when it came out 10 years ago, it was the first indian-made single malt ever.
