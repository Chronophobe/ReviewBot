if i cut batch 1 down to 90-proof, i don't think it's similar to er. closer to bt, maybe. i don't know. that would be an interesting experiment. release 2 might be closer to er though. i'd love to know if they're making adjustments. 

that would be something if they put barrels for stagg jr next to stagg and then decided to just pull er 10 barrels and bottle it instead for the second release.
