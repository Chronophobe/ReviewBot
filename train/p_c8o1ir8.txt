irish single malt. 46% abv.

* **color:** pale yellow.
* **nose:** takes some time to open up. light and creamy. fresh butter. grassy.
* **palate:** oily mouthfeel. clean tasting. not terribly complex but exceptionally smooth. woody.
* **finish:** a lot oak. honey. a mild sweetness, but with an artificial sweetener aftertaste. 

score: 83/100

woody and fairly dry.  the artificial sweetener aftertaste wasn't always there but i experienced it more than once. this is better than a lot of irish whiskies i've had, but i wasn't blown away. i definitely prefer bushmills 16.
