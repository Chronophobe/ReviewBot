of the cheap bourbons available in my area i wanted to see which you would recommend to use primarily to mix. right now all of my bourbon is mainly for drinking straight.

ancient age $33, jim beam black $29, wild turkey (81) $31, jim beam white $28, four roses yellow $27, old charter (10) $34.

or should i just buy something a bit better and also use that to mix? four roses small batch is only a fe dollars more at $40
