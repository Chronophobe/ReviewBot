no, i don't think they're all that similar. just from memory, owa is sweeter, more of that hot cinnamon, and cherry syrup-like. they're probably about similar to me on the edge fusel alcohol. maybe others can chime in.

i guess that's one downside of evaluating these individually. i usually line up what i think are similar bottles, but i don't usually do cross category like ceht and owa. thanks!
