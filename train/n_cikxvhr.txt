my local store only got 1 bottle of the four roses special edition this year. i was on the list 2 years ago to get the 2013 special edition, but there were too many people ahead of me on the list. they left me on for this year and i ended up being first in line for this year. lucky me! 

i can't wait to crack it open this evening and mix it with some diet coke.
