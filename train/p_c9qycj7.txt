**hanyu ichiro's malt 1991, 56.3% abv**

*cask no. 479, hogshead cask, bottle 34/200*

the hanyu distillery closed in 2000.

* nose: wood smoke and sandalwood. honeyed cereal and vanilla. burning charcoal. cherry tart. apple peel and maple syrup. spanish cedar from a well-stocked humidor. pepper and clove. ginseng and fertile soil. after letting it sit for a while, i'm getting some nuttiness and faint fortified wine notes.

* taste: medium-full bodied. apple cider and crisp barley â€“ quite sharp. there's a pleasant sourness similar to fresh mangosteen and lychee. sweet oak. candied ginger and salted kumquats. bitter black tea leaves add some earthiness. raw almonds and pine nuts.

* finish: wood smoke. tea tree oil. star anise, coriander seeds, clove and pepper. very faint  peat. coffee grounds. slightly medicinal. dry oaky tannins and spices. medium-long and dry.

this one is weird, but wonderful and unique. i don't know what else to say...

&gt;**89/100**
