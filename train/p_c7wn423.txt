**southern coast batch 001 museum release, 46% abv**

*bottle 21 of 170*

a bit of background before i begin. this is a single malt whisky from my home state of south australia. the distillery closed its doors late last year, shortly after releasing batch 007 which received a "liquid gold" prize in jim murray's whisky bible. i had no idea that this stuff existed until i was browsing an online store and came upon it by chance. i literally used to work right next to the distillery!

here are some notes from the [website:]( http://southerncoastdistillers.com.au/)
&gt;cask #22 was filled into an american oak port cask, re-made and re-furbished from a larger cask in october 2007.  it was botted at 46% in time for the mwsoa 2010 malt whisky awards where it won a credible bronze medal.

&gt;as this is the first release whisky from a brand new distillery we have classified all 170 bottles as museum stock and we are very happy that our first ever expression won a bronze medal

* nose: malty and sweet. toffee, vanilla beans and cocoa. smells a bit like st agnes xo which is a south australian brandy.

* taste: dry and tart, yet slightly oily and smooth. dry moscat grapes and honey. strong port and brandy notes, but also savoury and a bit meaty. dried figs, cinnamon and spices. faint wood smoke.

* finish: cayenne pepper and sea salt. burnt brown sugar and dark chocolate. again, i'm getting some brandy notes. medium, bitter and dry.

this is very flavourful for a first release and i'm very happy that i own this piece of history. i know that this was matured in a port cask, but i got a lot brandy notes which were very strange because i've never experience it before in other whiskies. 

i really want to get my hands on some of their other batches but sadly they're all sold out.

&gt;**88/100**
