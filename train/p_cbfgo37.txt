**still waters 1+11, 40% abv**

*blended canadian whisky*

sample courtesy of tomodera.

* nose: pine cones. sour green apples. perfume. diluted vanilla essence.  soft oak spice.  grassy and green.

* taste: thin and watery with some creaminess. pepper, grapefruit and apple. dry cider. brown sugar. a bit salty, minty and spicy.

* finish: grassy and bittersweet. swallow it and it's gone.

solid first effort. i don't mind light delicate whiskies but this almost made me fall asleep. 

&gt;**76/100**
