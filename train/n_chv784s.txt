nice! i'm down in portland or so i'm not too far away. i'll definitely be on the look out for that. i'm digging the rye world a lot. i really like knob creek's rye, but it's in the $40 range so it's not really a utility whiskey for me. i guess jw black is too, just personal preference i suppose. never been one for any jw myself
