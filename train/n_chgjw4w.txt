if it was re-distilled after three years, it would probably be more accurate to count it as 9 years old (though, again, having never heard of re-distilling *after* ageing, except in cases where things have gone horribly wrong during the ageing process and the distiller doesn't want to waste anything, i have no idea).

the question all this raises for me, actually, is how old the standard forty creek entries are. but my fingers are crossed that at some point we will see some super-aged forty creek juice. i'd definitely love to get my hands on an 18 year old whisky from them, though i suspect hall is more interested in wild mini-experiments than straight ageing.
