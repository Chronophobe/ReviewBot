the downvotes are for the tone not the content of your comment. i agree, the title could be less clickbaity, but the tone was uncalled for.

ralfy can afford to ramble, he's very well-respected, and people know that waiting a few minutes for him to get to his point is almost always worth it. sorry you felt i wasted your time.

edit: i'm not being sarcastic, by the by, i'm genuinely unhappy that i annoyed you so much with the title.
