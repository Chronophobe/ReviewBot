yesterday, 3 friends and i visited the rhein ruhr whisky fair held in düsseldorf, germany.

the fair was held at the classic remise which is an old railway roundhouse that has been converted into a classic car storage facility / showroom / renovation centre.

the fair started at 12:00 and continued till 20:00 (we left at around 18:30).  cost was €10 to enter which got us a tasting glass and lanyard to hold it.  we booked tickets in advance which seemed to be a good idea as there was a large queue at one point of people who had just turned up on the day and they seemed to have stopped letting people in at one point.

we also paid an extra €25 euros for a one hour talk and tasting with graeme bowie, the distillery manager at ardnamurchan. this is a new distillery being built by adelphi.  

as part of this we tasted:


fascadale batch 6 (clynelish), 46%, 12 years.

glenrothes 2007, 67.7%, 7 years, cask. 3519, 1st fill sherry.

benriach 1990, 52.9%, 23 years, cask. 10698, refill sherry.

bunnahabhain 1989, 47.2%, 24 years, cask. 5787, refill bourbon.

adelphi private stock reserve blend.


the atmosphere in the main fair was superb as was the location with some great cars to look.

there were a good selection of distilleries and private bottlers with lots of bottles to sample. far to many to choose from.  samples were generally 2cl and ranged from €1 to €8 for the ones i tried.

between the 4 of us, we tried and sniffed a great deal of whisky. the ones i remember trying in no particular order:


the maltman mortlach 22yr

coal ila moch

kavalan taiwanese whiskey

bruichladdich black art

octomore

lost distilleries auchnagie

lost distilleries gerston

slyrs pedro ximenex finish

laing's old particular laphroaig 15yr

sansibar tomintoul 46yr

edradour sauternes finish


we will be going back next year.


tl:dr went to whisky fair and drank whisky.
