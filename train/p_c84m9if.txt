**review #2 - yamazaki 12 year old - $15 dram**

this is a partner review to go with [dramfan's review #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/scotch/comments/17ayuo/macallan_12_yr_review_1/)

**scene:** the bookstore bar. what a beautiful day in seattle, and made all the more beautiful with a dram or two of our favorite intoxicant.  dramfan and i took the light rail from work to get a bit of peanut brittle and while walking back felt a bit rumbly in the tumbly and decided to stop for a bite to eat; low and behold we were near a whiskey bar and had to stop in.  we asked for bunnahabhain 12 yr for the community review, but were rebuked unfortunately.  taking up the menus we placed our orders: i the shepard's pie; dramfan, a sandwich.  to accompany these we chose macallan and yamazaki 12 years.

**color (18/25):** light spun gold. no legs whatsoever. the oak casks really keep this coloring light and airy.

**nose (23/25):** had the vapors of a warm spring afternoon.  melted sugars and caramel.  very noticeable alcohol.

**taste (24/25):** clean and crisp orchard flavors.  citrus.

**finish (12/25):** the end of a fruit roll up.  plastic.

**overall (77/100):** this was an interesting taste.  it has all the trappings of something light and fun, but the finish really falls flat for me.  i wanted something that took me somewhere and while most of the nose and taste bring me to my great aunt's orchard outside of newburg, oregon, the finish left me wanting. 

**bottom line:** this is actually something i could really get into.  if i went into the drink knowing that the end is the worst part, i would try to minimize that aspect while pulling out all of the better portions.  this is a whiskey i will need to further investigate.
