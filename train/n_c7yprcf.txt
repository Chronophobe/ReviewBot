hmm i've tried the [robert burns](http://www.arranwhisky.com/robert-burns-range/robert-burns-single-malt-43-70cl/) by them, it was good and at a great price.  i'll definitely have to check out the sauternes version. it's $77 here, so more than i wanted to spend this time. but i'll pick it up another time.
