who is pacifen? awesome sauce, that's who. and the person who sent me a great sample of the next dram i'll be reviewing, **amrut fusion.**

last week i reviewed the [amrut cask strength](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1fuxdh/amrut_cask_strength_review/), granted a day late. i've been cutting back on drinking the past while, and exercising/working has taken up a lot of my time, so when i finally won myself a free weekend, i decided it was time to catch up on some of the amazing samples i received from swaps while catching up on game of thrones (finally). haven't seen the 10th episode yet, so let's keep this thread spoiler free.

when i first read about **amrut fusion**, i assumed it would be a fancy way of saying "double barreled". and you know what happens when you assume? you're a jack ass and you're wrong, that's what.

and let me tell you, i was super wrong. it's actually a fusion of barley grown in scotland and india. so i was a little confused during my review, as i was expecting more currants, dates, strawberries, and fruits. then i decided to not try to review with guessing what i was reviewing, and looked some things up to make sure i wasn't going insane.

jury's still out on my sanity, so let's move along to my review.

**region:** india

**abv:** 50%

**price:** $68.95 (cad)

**colour:** light pus

**nose:** strawberries, sticky toffee, lemon curd, basil, peat, musk, white cake, dark cherry syrup, vanilla

very nice nose on this one. somewhat sweet, somewhat peaty, somewhat musky, has a little bit of everything. almost going in 5 directions at once, which worries me a little bit, as typically that means it won't work that well. takes awhile to open up, which is odd for something at 50% abv.

**taste:** lemon juice, jalapeno, pepper, peat, cumin, cucumber, apple, sour cherry, licorice, oak, almond, strawberry

hmmm... it's quite hot and sweet now, almost like a highland. and if you've been following me, you'll know that i'm not the biggest fan of that highland flavour. on the other hand, it's not weak, there's some peat, and the fruit/oak mixture pairs well. jury's still out on this one.

wow, that jury is busy.

i'm missing some of the overwhelming flavours from the cask strength i think. which is silly, as this is 50%, which is amazing, and i'm being silly and i need to get over it. i need to come down to earth after some of these drams, i'm being spoiled.

**finish:** lime rind, peat, hazelnut, dry, soil, parsley, cocoa, chili powder, dry, soil, parlsley, leather

medium length on the finish, nice calming flavours that fade away leaving a dryness and an odd hybrid of highland/islay flavours. i think the finish is the best part of this one.

**conclusion:** it's never easy reviewing a whisky after you've had a similar one from the same distillery with a higher abv. and it's not really fair to compare them, however that's why we have numbers and that's why we review.

**amrut fusion** is good, and i would buy a bottle, even at the lcbo prices. that being said, there are some misses here. when you read that it's a mixture of barley from different places, it does suffer from a somewhat disjoint flavour profile. it does a lot of things, and while some of those things match up, it's all over the place. i'm very glad that they didn't finish this one with a wine cask of some sort, as that would have overworked my tongue more.

and as we've learned from michael douglas this past week, an overworked tongue can be deadly.

**83/100**
