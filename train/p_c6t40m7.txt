some of you may remember one of my first posts to this forum about half a year ago. i had come across six bottles of this particular yamazaki. well it got the best of me, and last night with a close friend and my brother in law we opened a bottle around a bonfire. here are my notes.

color: red amber (darkest malt i've ever seen) no artificial coloring.

nose: sweet spice, cinnamon, ripe citrus, vanilla and japanese oak.

taste: sweet, citrusy sour (very unique imparting from the japanese oak, surprisingly very pleasant) at 25 years in the oak, it is very mature and complex on the tongue. left us a bit speechless as we had not any other malt to liken it too.

finish: expansive, it's like it changes elements and turns into a solid (cream) filling your mouth. we savored this for quite a while as the taste lingered for quite a while. 

i told my friends the story about how i came across this plunder and while they didn't expect to actually taste of it's sweet juice i could tell they were itching. fortunately, the malt lived up to it's story. we all loved it and ended up drinking 2/3 the bottle. 

i purchased this bottle for $49.99 usd but i think the going rate when maltmasters sold out was about $1,500 a bottle. if you happened to find a bottle in between the two prices i would thoroughly recommend it.
