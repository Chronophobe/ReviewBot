**forty creek barrel select canadian whisky 40% abv ($23 for 750 ml)**

*color:* light, more yellow than amber.

*nose:* butter, custard, vanilla (specifically vanilla yogurt), and caramel. also dried pears, a touch of roasted nuts, and a subdued -but still present- grain/rubbing alcohol note. this latter is what usually steers me away from the canadians, but it is faint here: overall a nice nose.

*palate:* gentle and sweet attack with noticeable malt influence. starts off like irish or a sweeter blended scotch in this regard. corn sweetness follows with only a small amount of rye spice. the alcohol is not very well controlled here and seems far higher than 40%. the palate is thin.

*finish:* noticeable spirity burn, then a lingering hint of the cheap vodka we drank in college. maybe a touch of rye in there and a faint perfume note. really falls apart here.

final rating **82/100**

i really hoped for more out of this, and what is frustrating is that i can tell there is good whisky in here. i think the blending process went awry, leaving it to seem disjointed and not well-integrated. also, there is just too much spirity heat, i'd guess from too much base whisky. i understand that this is $23 whiskey, but i'd far rather pay more and get more rather than have some really good stuff watered down with alcohol and water. even at this price point i can think of many bourbons that thoroughly crush this spirit.

all of that said, i suspect that the upper-level offerings from forty creek are quite good, as this tastes like it has that potential. further, based on the jefferson's i last reviewed, it is clear that alberta seriously knows what they are doing, and i'm told wiser's does too. for these reasons, i will continue to have hope for canadian, but will leave off drinking or reviewing canadian whisky until these higher quality offerings are available to me.
