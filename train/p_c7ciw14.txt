hello worldwhisky, a few weeks ago i posted [wigle aging kit]( https://www.wiglewhiskey.com/) and an accompanying un-aged **wigle white wheat whiskey (80 proof)** [review]( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/12efn1/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_a_review/). i am sorry i took so long to get the 4 day review but sealing the barrel took much longer than expected. so here goes. 

colour: pale straw

nose: fresh cut hay, grass and lemon, prunes, wood smoke and alcohol. not much change in 4 days except the cereal notes are much more apparent. 

taste: hay, lemon, grass and a little peppery. the taste is far less dominated by the alcohol just after 4 days and the dram is much mellower. there has been a large improvement in only a short time period. 

finish: cereal grains and modest alcohol flavour. like the taste profile the finish is far better, however, it is still very short lived and not complex.

only after 4 days the whiskey has improved markedly and is almost drinkable. i still cannot recommend this dram yet but if the improvements keep up it should be a pretty drinkable dram. 

overall i would score this dram 55/100, an improvement over the original but still has a ways to go! my next review will be at 7 days (sunday december 9th).
