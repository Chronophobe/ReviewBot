this is my first review, please enjoy! this is my first foray into non-western whisky. i present to you the yamazaki 12 year single malt whisky from the yamazaki distillery in, you guessed it, japan.

**color:** light amber, gold highlight

**nose:** tangy sweet - mango, tart apple, juniper. light applewood smoke. bloom settles to a peppermint candy.

**palate:** bright with a snap. not very oily. sweetness takes a backseat to a woodsy taste, smoked and nutty.

**finish:** the sweet sticks around for the finale. very little burn, more tingle. licorice.

**overall:** this isn't a scotch drinker's whisky, i wouldn't think, but it's a good experience if you know what you're getting into. the japanese blend is very traditional in distillation to scottish whisky, but if i had to put my palate on trial, it has a very close comparison to sake. the rice wine resemblance is very prominent, you could drink this through a bamboo straw and it wouldn't change the taste. not to say the region impacts the flavor, but i'd hearken a guess that its popularity overseas is a result of the similarity. i enjoy this, and would have it again, but not at the expense of having a more full bodied, less sweet whisky on hand as an occasional alternative.

i would very much like to compare it to the 18 year, it apparently is in a completely separate league. thank you for your time.
