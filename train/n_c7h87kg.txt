&gt; in 1577, it was noted of irish whiskey that

&gt;"it sloeth age, it strengtheneth youth, it helpeth digestion,
it cutteth fleume, it abandoneth melancholy, it relisheth the hart,
it lighteneth the mind, it quickeneth the spirites...
...truly it is a souveraigne liquor, if it be orderly taken."

&gt;(raphael holinshed, "history of ireland", 1577)
