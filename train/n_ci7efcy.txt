you've got a point on the rr website, but the big difference between saz and rr is rr is a documented change. not only that, but i've got bottles of both rr 8-year and nas, so i know there was a change. saz is widely cited as being 6 yo, so before i'd say otherwise, i'd just like a good reference. i really don't care one way or another, i just want to be reasonably accurate.
