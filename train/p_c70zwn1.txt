**lion's pride 47th ward single barrel organic whiskey**

*color: beautiful golden amber

*nose: hints of brown sugar, vanilla and caramel giving way to an incredibly strong smell of fresh cooked raisin bread and sweet bananas.

*taste: started very smooth like sweet butter and caramel before giving way to strong balance of raisins and rye bread.

*finish: good warmth and very dry. the 4-grain mash bill really comes out here and and coats your entire palate. the soft, sweet undertones up front give way to a very bold rye finish which fills your entire mouth before lingering nicely in the back of your throat. the rye really breaks through the smooth sweetness towards the end adding wonderfully to the balance.

*overall: this is definitely the most pleasantly surprising whiskey i've ever had. the sweet and savoriness of the nose played very well together and the very bold rye finish makes it hard to believe it's only 12.5 % rye. the seamless transitions from subtle and sweet to bold and dry make it incredibly balanced. all around, it's amazing how well all the flavors work together but still stand out. this is a must for rye lovers .
