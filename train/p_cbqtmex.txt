hi all, back to /r/worldwhisky for something a little out of the ordinary. no, this is not about the time i met up with some army buddies down by the creek and ate raw poblanos and exlax, this is a texas single malt!

thanks again to /u/pacifen for sending me the sample. much appreciated to try some of these small, local malts. i've been saving this one until my one buddy could have some as well, as we were both very interested in trying. you've made our weekend, pacifen.

**ranger creek rimfire mesquite smoked texas single malt whiskey** is a special edition texas single malt from the small ranger creek brewery and distillery. only 500 cases of this stuff was made, and as the name will tell you, they use mesquite to smoke the whisky rather than the traditional peat used in scotland. to amp up the smokiness, this is made from their mesquite smoked porter.

if i lived in texas, i'd probably have some trouble fitting into parts of it due to my religious and social views as well as my general indifference towards sports.... however i'd be buying their special "small caliber" series each year... or maybe a case.

**region:** texas

**abv:** 43%

**price:** n/a

**colour:** old copper wire

**nose:** soft smoke, perfume, passionfruit, mango, orange peel, peach, honeysuckle

it's really hard to explain this one. it isn't peaty. it's soft smoke. it's not smoke that'll run around and desert you, make you cry, or say goodbye. why? well, for one, it's an inanimate object, so it can't say goodbye. also it's mellow. like a fruit flavoured tobacco almost.

**taste:** sour peach, soft smoke, mesquite, burn, vanilla, rock salt, bbq

i personally am not a person who puts too much credit into terroir, however i have to give this one credit, it tastes like i'd imagine a southern bbq would taste, from mesquite bbq all the way to peach cobbler. very good.

**finish:** peach, earth, mushroom, bubblegum, lemongrass, tobacco, gravel, angel food cake

little bit more earthiness than i'm used to. also quite sweet at the end. i want more.

**conclusion:** wow, i wish i could get a bottle of this. one sample is just not enough! it's smooth, it's smokey, it has some nuts and it's sweet. if this is a sign of what's to come out of texas, i'm ready to start buying more single malts from texas.

**86/100**
