i put it in quotes because most of what gets made in india wouldn't qualify as whisk(e)y anywhere else. the blends have vodka and rum in them.

take bagpiper. it's pot still malt blended with neutral spirits made from molasses, basically rum.

royal stag, which was mentioned, is a mix of mostly neutral grain spirits (not grain whisky, but essentially super high proof vodka) with a small amount of imported scottish malt.

snobbery has nothing to do with it. it's about the common definitions used everywhere else. most of what gets sold under indian brand names don't meet those standards. indian law doesn't define what whisky is supposed to be, and the lower-tier stuff doesn't even have the 10 or 15% of imported scottish malt whisky that brands like royal stag or bagpiper do.

i was in india for almost two years. i've actually tried a lot of this stuff. it's in quotes because it belongs in quotes. indians who like whisk(e)y and can afford better don't drink it.
