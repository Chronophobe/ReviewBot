i picked this up as part of my quest to try all of ian buxton's *101 whiskies to try before you die*. i was lucky enough to try the special 01 eminent sherry a few months ago  (which is cask strength) and i enjoyed that. this wasn't quite as nice but it's still a good whisky. it's young (i've heard 3-4 years) but aged in small casks so it ages quicker. it's a bit rough but a lot smoother than you'd expect for something that young. probably won't buy it again but i'm happy that it came in a 1 liter bottle.
