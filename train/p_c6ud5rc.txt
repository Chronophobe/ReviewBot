hello, i received a [wigle aging kit]( https://www.wiglewhiskey.com/) as a gift and decided that my first review would be un-aged **wigle white wheat whiskey (80 proof)**. i plan on posting reviews at various ages (4 days, 7 days, 10 days, etc.) when i begin aging next week. the aging kit consist of a 1 litre oak barrel, 750 ml white wheat whiskey and 2 glasses. 

colour: transparent

nose: at first strong floral nose with raisin and prune notes, while lemon, fresh cut hay, alcohol and a hint of wood smoke finish.    

taste: very aggressive alcohol taste to start but hay, sour and sugary notes come through. not much tasteâ€¦yet

finish: very light wood smoke.

this dram turned out how i expected it to, not much complexity or finish but the real fun is in the aging process. i would not recommend this in its un-aged state to sip on but the novelty of aging your own whisky is too much to pass up. i will keep you updated and post more reviews as the days go by. 

overall i would score this dram 50/100, an interesting dram but i am more excited about what is to come.
