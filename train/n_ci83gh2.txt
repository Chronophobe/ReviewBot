* 12oz frozen lemonade concentrate
* 6oz frozen orange juice concentrate
* 2 cups brewed black tea
* 7 cups water
* 3 cups bourbon (we used four roses but you can go nuts)

mix all in a large bowl (my dutch oven was the only thing big enough), and place in the freezer for 24 hours, or at least overnight.  mixture will freeze into the perfect slushie consistency on its own, no need to crush or break up the ice.

scoop 1 cup into a glass and serve with a spoon, or top with ginger ale to create a fabulous cocktail.  contains approx. 1.5oz of bourbon per serving.

all the recipes we looked at online called for adding a cup of sugar, this seemed totally unnecessary to us, so we just added an extra cup of bourbon instead!  you get the full bourbon flavor, and just the right amount of *kick*  even people that said they didn't like bourbon or whiskey were blown away by this drink, and it disappeared before halftime.

cheers from tn, and feel free to modify our recipe!  next time we will probably use something stronger than the 90 proof four roses.
