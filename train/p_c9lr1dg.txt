so i was looking for a bottle of irish whiskey for this past st. patty’s day and wanted to venture beyond my usual standard jameson. i have read a lot on the cooley and kilbeggan distilleries over the last year and i was intrigued by a lot of what i read. their double distilling vs. triple distilling was cool. will that add some fullness to the flavors? i was intrigued with their use of corn/maize for their grain whiskey. how will that play with the malt? the fact that they had been independent, until being purchased by beam inc. last year, made me excited to try their stuff. i mean, beam couldn’t have ruined it that quick, right? anyway, i snagged a bottle of kilbeggan, their irish blend, at my local total wine for $20. i had a glass or two left, so here’s a review.  

* **nose:** very malty. cereal grain notes. major apple juice aromas. vanilla. custard. buttery honey. my wife loves to eat her biscuits with butter and honey, i get lots of aromas that bring her biscuits to mind.  
* **palate:** much more full of a mouthfeel than standard jameson or bushmills. very oily and full for being 40% abv. malt flavors. vanilla. faint oak. honey. not much apple fruitiness.  
* **finish:** very dry, oaky finish. more malt and cereal grains.  
* **overall:** i happened to be a bit of an irish whiskey fan and i really enjoyed this. the biscuit-y, buttery, honey aromas and flavors along with the fuller mouth feel were impressive. i really think the double distilling has made a difference. the flavors just seem so much more vibrant. i would love to try this at a higher abv. i have to say, i enjoyed this more than my usual jameson and much more than bushmills, which i don’t really care for at all. still not on the redbreast level though. can’t wait to try more of the cooley stuff.
