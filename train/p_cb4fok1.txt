sample courtesy of studiorat.

* nose: rye sourdough. sweet ginger, lychee and musk sticks. creamy oak vanillin. leafy and floral. almond nougat. white pepper.

* taste: thin and watery. very woody - oak, maple and pine. citrus peel and sour apple cider. salted caramel. sweetened black tea. sugar-free spearmint gum. more floral notes. lightly spicy and peppery.

* finish: perfume. savoury herbs. burnt toast. way too short.

very floral and woody canadian whisky. enjoyable but 40% = ಠ╭╮ಠ
