this is $85 in ontario and i am wondering it it is worth the money. have not had a chance to sample it. our prices are generally high, but this is the only highwest available right now and i am interested in their products. any thoughts would be appreciated. i think they rotate which high west is available, should i wait for a different as they will all likely be the same price.
