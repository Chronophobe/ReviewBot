so when you think whiskey, you usually jump first to scotland, then to the us, canada, ireland, and if you've gotten into it, japan, india, and australia. however i am excited at the idea of other countries making whisky for themselves. it's the possibility of different flavours, terroir, and techniques to try new things. i worked out great for the wine industry, why not the whisky industry?

that's partially why i picked up the **armorik breton single malt**. it's from france, which you typically don't hear about making anything beyond wine and brandy. but it makes sense, as half of france (specifically where this one is found, breton) was controlled by the uk. someone had to wander about the empire and make whisky somewhere, right?

also picked it up as the price was pretty good for the abv., non-chill filtration, and no colouring.

let's see if i bought a gimmicky whisky.

**region:** france

**price:** $54.95 (cad)

**abv:** 46%

**colour:** fake banana

**nose:** corn, tulips, peaches, alcohol, lime, pears, grass, sour cherry, macadamia nuts

somewhere between a lowland and a bourbon nose on this one. starts out by bringing you flowers, then hands you a fruit bowl, like some impressionistic film that has subtitles and is in black and white. you may be on a train. 

there's still an alcohol smell that takes over after awhile.

**taste:** lime, cardamom, spicy caramel, herbs, butter, large blueberries, smoke, mixed nuts

familiar flavours at first, however there's more to this as it opens up. the "large blueberries" taste is more weak, as blueberries get stronger and sweeter as they get smaller. i could see having this with some chocolate or an ice cream. or perhaps just miming it, on a summer day, perhaps after a smoke.

**finish:** plums, mushrooms, peppery, pear, light strawberry, dry, alcohol burn, peanut oil

short finish on this one, kinda like a pinot grigio. i was hoping for something more full bodied actually, and was let down. like life, which is a grape in the sea of time.

**conclusion:** okay, enough jokes about french cinema, this is a pretty good start for a new regions single malt. it has that bourbon/lowland feel, it's not coloured, chill filtered or even that watered down. there's some rough edges to it; the nose has a burn, the taste misses on some notes, and the finish is short and weak. i think with some time, work, and even tweaking this could be a real contender for a nice world whisky.

**80/100**
