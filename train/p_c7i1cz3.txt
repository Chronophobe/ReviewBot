for my fifth review, a secret santa special:
penderyn madeira single malt welsh whisky.

my secret santa noticed i frequent r/scotch, but since he was welsh he figured i should try some of his local stuff. he also dug through my history and noticed my affection for talisker, and got me a talisker flask!

**nose:**: fruity, almost to the point of cognac.

**taste:** sweet. prunes, and a rich, oily fruitiness. very unique.

**finish:** my favoriite part of this whisky. it lingers in a comforting, warm way. the fruity taste gives way to hazelnut, vanilla and a hint of nougat.

this was the perfect secret santa gift! i think my only specification was "i like things that i can't get in sweden", and indeed, this whisky isn't available in here. the score might seem a bit low, but that is mostly due to my own preference of peat and smoke (which was non-existant in this whisky), but it's definitely something i could see myself get a bigger bottle of if i'm ever in wales, and it seems perfect as an avec with coffee and desert.

**score 80/100**
