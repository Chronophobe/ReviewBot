took a trip to colorado a few weeks ago and couldn’t resist the stranahan’s tour. the whisky is quite hard to find outside of the state of colorado and the idea of an american single malt aged in charred new oak barrels really intrigued me. the tour itself was fairly short since stranahan’s is such a small distillery but it felt quite intimate since they limit the tour group sizes. one of the coolest parts of the tour was the bottling room. it’s very small and they only have one machine, but all the bottling is done by volunteers who sign up online. while the volunteers work they are fed beer and pizza and get to take home a bottle of stranahan’s afterward; not a bad deal in my opinion.

**stranahan’s colorado whisky, 47% abv, $60**

**color:** takes on a nice caramel color from the charred oak

**nose:** is this a bourbon i’m smelling? fresh oak, heavy vanilla, sourdough bread. young yet refined nose.

**taste:** caramel sweetness, cinnamon spice, lemon zest. the malt character comes through here.

**finish:** long, warm, lingering. warm bread and crème brulee.

**conclusion:** a well constructed, solid whisky. despite its youth (blend of barrels aged from 2-5 years) it has a surprising amount of balance to it and has very little young alcohol character (except a little on the nose). i asked the tour guide if they had any plans to release any older bottlings and he explained that their output is just not high enough to fund it. while i understand that this is a limitation of being a small distillery, i can’t help but be a little disappointed because this whisky would be stellar with some more time in the barrels. however, it’s a very unique and quality product as it stands and the charred oak barrels give it a nice bourbon-like quality. 

**86/100**
