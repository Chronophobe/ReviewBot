good evening world whisky, caterpillar here with a dual review of buffalo trace and kilchoman. why you ask? because, as pointed out in our beginner question thread, kilchoman purchases barrels from buffalo trace to age their whisky in. therefore, i figured what better reason to pick up a new bottle of bourbon!

furthermore, i’d like to thank rockindaddy for the delicious sample sent to me thanks to /r/scotchswap.

**buffalo trace kentucky straight bourbon 45% abv**

* color: copper

* nose: oak, allspice, char, vanilla bean, honey, corn, chocolate, nutmeg and cinnamon. reminds me of fall baking spices.

* taste: light feel. more oak, allspice, white pepper, corn, char, citrus and honey

* finish: short and spiced. no burn, but warm. the oak and white pepper simmer nicely together.

* overall: this is wonderful bourbon. it’s not overly complex, but at $20, it’s a great bang-for-your-buck option. nicely spiced, warm, and straightforward. my kind of bourbon on a cool night and deserves a consistent spot atop my fridge.

 **84/100**

**kilchoman summer 2010 release single malt whisky 46% abv**

* color: chardonnay. no e150 here.

* nose: iodine, peat reek, moss, fresh baking bread, and bacon fat.

* taste: so light it’s like a drink of air. big peat, iodine, medicinal, campfire smoke, sea air, malt, cereal, bacon, tobacco, tiniest touch of oak.

* finish: not much to it. very short, big peat, no burn to be found at all.

* overall: this is a three-year-old whisky and this young gun has big flavors, but not much complexity. it’s not exactly my style, but i could understand the idea here. the flavor profile is pretty much entirely reflective of the distillation, while buffalo trace’s barrel has imparted only a slight bit of flavor. it is youthful and the lack of any balance of flavors beyond peat is a result.

**78/100**

wow. these whiskies could not be more different. they’re aged in the same barrels and that’s where the similarities end. they truly are worlds apart, but both represent their own particular sect of the whisky-enjoying world very well. all around, a fairly tasty couple of whiskies.
