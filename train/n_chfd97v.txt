&gt; (or any alcohol)

even beer?

i've had nights where i've drunk the equivalent of a half bottle of scotch, but they are very few and far between and i definitely don't drink anything close to that anymore. although i am eighteen, so it's probably bad either way.

but yeah, the thought of drinking that much makes me want to throw up.
