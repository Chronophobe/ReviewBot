they're basically little dye tablets that my mom made us use. after you brush your teeth and floss, you either dissolve it on your tongue or chew it up, swishing it around your mouth. it stains any leftover plaque (normally a reddish hue) so you can see if you missed anything. 

they've got a very distinct sweet vegetal funkiness about them, and i was thrown back to my childhood bathroom as soon as i opened the sample. super weird!
