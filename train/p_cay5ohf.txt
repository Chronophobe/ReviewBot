**hakushu heavily peated, 48 % abv**

*limited edition peated single malt from suntory's hakushu distillery, matured in american white oak (i'm guessing ex-bourbon). nas and ncf.*

* nose: caramel, butter and vanilla. soft briny and phenolic peat smoke. grassy and woody with some cedar and charred oak.  korean plum wine. lime leaves. a bit of black liquorice in the background. almond oil. genmaicha with jasmine.

* taste: crisp and zesty on the palate with a slight oily texture. more of the korean plum wine from the nose. ginger, citrus and toffee apples. dried mango. peppery and lightly spicy. well balanced with some dry oak and floral peat.

* finish: fresh and fruity with lingering earthy medicinal notes. pepper, oak and smoky black tea. some lemongrass. medium-long and dry.

one of the best world whiskies i've ever had. complex and beautifully balanced from start to finish. it's almost like the best parts of a peated bruichladdich and talisker were mixed together, with a crisp and fresh character i get with ib bowmores. love it.
