**forty creek port wood reserve, 45% abv :d**

sample courtesy of studiorat.

* nose: citric tartness. sour plums. dried fruits. pine trees. caramel and vanilla. fresh mint and lemongrass. a whiff of wood smoke.

* taste: medium bodied and slightly viscous. sweet spearmint candy. bubblegum. resinous pine. potpourri and mint. light oak spice and pepper. sultana and date. cinnamon sugar and clove. milk chocolate. sweet tobacco.

* finish: sweet basil and honeyed cereal. lovely delicate oak spice. medium length, floral and minty. very nice.

sweet but not too sweet, perfectly spiced, well balanced oak,  floral without smelling like cheap perfume.

i really like this one! the best canadian i've had.
