home visiting my parents. my dad and i don’t exactly see eye-to-eye when it comes to whisky: he likes the light and smooth (and the flavoured). i tend to prefer the more intense (the laphroaig i left behind last year hasn’t been touched). but on the other hand, checking his cabinet when i get home always gives me the chance to try a couple things i might not have otherwise invested in.

like crown royal maple. which i’m not exactly looking forward to. but, for science! i had some not-kind things to say about jack daniels honey, but there are reasons for some tentative optimism here: higher abv, the fact that i prefer the taste of maple syrup to the taste of honey anyway, the fact that (allegedly) the addition of the maple is done in a slightly more subtle way (with the addition of “maple toasted oak staves,” whatever that phrase means, to barrels—rather than just adding some syrup). on the other hand. . . . yeah, i still think this isn’t going to go well.

**crown royal maple finished canadian whisky**; nas; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $29 cdn. in the province of alberta.

**appearance:** e150a. without a doubt. decent legs, but that’s no doubt attributable to the added sugar. crown royal has nice branding, though. so there’s that.

**nose:** umm... yeah. sweet. maple syrup. but like a mix of real maple syrup and that fake store-brand “maple-flavoured” pancake syrup (more of the latter than the former, though). maybe a bit of caramel, vanilla. a toasted woody character. taffy? toffee. dusty gravel road. hard water. but mostly maple. very little of the crown royal character (bourbon-lite™, as i like to call it) comes through.

**taste:** a bit more of the crown royal profile comes through here, but it’s still mostly maple. interestingly thin, despite the sticky sugariness. smooth, if nothing else. a bit less over-the-top sweet than i was expecting, but don’t get me wrong it’s still very, very sweet. some tingling heat, which at least acknowledges you’re drinking an actual spirit. vanilla, caramel. a slightly more authentic maple-syrup taste than the smell would suggest.

**finish:** there and gone. sweet, maple, toasted wood. more elusive hints of the base (actual whisky!) spirit (hey, some corn!).

**final thoughts:** again, yeah. this stuff obviously isn’t intended for me, or for whisky nerds in general. it seems to me to be better made than jack daniels honey (fewer distinctly off-notes, doesn’t have that bile-ish quality i got from the jd), but it’s very sweet, very one-note, and very not whisky-like (although i actually think a whisky-maker could do something interesting with maple if they upped the whisky’s rye content, to play on the spicy-sweet potential). smooth, though, and it doesn’t really offend me. it wouldn’t be my first choice (or my second, or my third, or my . . . etc., etc.,), but i could drink it without wincing (although, again, i do like me some maple syrup). and if it attracts people to *actual* whisky, that’s cool too, i guess. my dad likes it. more power to him.

**score:** 69
