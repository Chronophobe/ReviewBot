**mackmyra distillery, mackmyra, gästrikland, sweden**  
  
founded in 1999 by a group of whisky-loving students, mackmyra is the oldest distillery in sweden, and the only one out there already marketing different bottlings. the mackmyra first edition is one of the most popular expressions, coming back batch after batch.  
  
to quote a popular swedish proverb:  
  
&gt;blott sverige svenska krusbär har.  
  
since i have nothing more to say about sweden, instead of trying to do a bad joke about ikea let's get right to the tasting session…  
  
**nose (23):**  
fruit salad with a bit of vanilla in its syrup. smell again, vanilla takes over, with a curiously pleasant alcohol burn. touch of flowers at the end, excellent.  
  
**taste (24):**  
again sweet vanilla. oak and spices complete this masterpiece. fireworks in your mouth, sweet wildberries and smurfberries, om nom nom...  
  
**finish (23):**  
all that was experienced before resurfaces here and slowly goes away. this finish could be longer, but anyhow... i'll just have to take another dram.  
  
**balance (23.5):**  
if you have a sweet tooth, this is an excessively dangerous whisky. if you're having a glass and that you get some excellent news, for instance "you're gonna be a dad", i have a good feeling that the bottle won't last the evening.  
  
**final score: 93.5/100**
