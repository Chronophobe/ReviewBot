well, i managed to forget to mention in the title that this is a review. sorry about that!. 

hello, all, i'm here with a canadian whisky review to celebrate are new little subreddit.
this is the forty creek double barrel reserve. i got a sample bottle when i grabbed a bottle of forty creek's copper pot reserve.
with the double barrel, corn, rye and barley whiskies are all aged separately in bourbon barrels. after some aging, they are combined to age again in another bourbon barrel.
it is bottled at 40% abv and released without age statement.

**body and colour**

* deep caramel and lightly bodied.

**nose**

* *neat:* sugar, fruit, caramel, vanilla, light oak. simple and pleasant. 

* *diluted:* caramel, apples, pear drops, brown sugar, a rum-like spiciness. vanilla. it reminds me a little bit of apple crisp. really quite nice.

**palate**

* *neat:* caramel, with almose a licorice spice. oaky, but not overly. slightly malty as well. 

* *diluted:* a sugary punch with fruit. apple and pears, licorice. oaky complexity with a slight cereal taste.

**finish**

* *neat:* soft and short. licorice on the tongue. warm.

* *diluted:* soft and short, again. almost not even there. slight licorice taste, but gone too soon. 

overall, this isn't a bad dram. the oakiness certainly isn't overwhelming, and adds some nice complexity to the malt. there are some nice flavours in there, and the bourbon influence shows. i really enjoyed the nose and palate, the flavours complimented each other well and used the oak nicely. where this really falls flat with me is the finish. while i feel there could be a great finish, it's gone too quickly to really appreciate. it's surprisingly soft for a young malt, but definitely short. 


score: 81
