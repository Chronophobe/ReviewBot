i just got back from a convention in louisville and i made sure to go tour some distilleries (woodford reserve, four roses, and buffalo trace). it was pretty cool finding out that woodford reserve uses north dakota rye, and buffalo trace uses north dakota barley. if you couldn't tell, i am from north dakota.

anyway, i was able to bring back:

* willett pot still reserve

* e.h. taylor single barrel bib

* four roses private selection obso

* four roses private selection obsk

* buffalo trace bourbon cream

* woodford reserve sassafras &amp; sorghum bitters

* woodford reserve bourbon vanilla simple syrup

* woodford reserve bourbon balls

all stuff i have never seen in my town, so i am pretty happy.
