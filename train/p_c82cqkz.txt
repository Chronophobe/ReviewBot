* **value**: 6/10

* **overall**: 71/100, i had very high hopes for this one and maybe it was because of those expectations that i was disappointed.  the spirit is definitely not bad, but nothing special and very forgettable.  i did prefer the yamazaki 12 to the hibiki 12 because i felt it was more unique.  thanks for the sample bigmoneysalsa!
