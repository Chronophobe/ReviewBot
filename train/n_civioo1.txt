2 part raw sugar
1 part kentucky straight bourbon
1 tsp cinnamon



slow boil bourbon, add cinnamon, add all sugar slowly, stir till dissolved, make label and put in dispenser.



this is for expediting the process however. a truly great "old fashioned" matures over the time of the drink. i don't suggest this for anyone who love the evolution of the drink but i highly suggest this if you are trying to expediting the process for making many. bourbon buddies...it's party time.



1 oz of "old fashioned" simple syrup, 2 dashes of your favorite bitters and 2-3 fingers of you're favorite bourbon. it's dreamy.
