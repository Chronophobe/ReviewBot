that's true, but i managed to find several whiskies of different ages that were produced by the same distiller and aged in the same type of cask (for example, the macallan had a sherry oak aged series, also big props to the sales reps at master of malt for helping with this!).  with enough samples, we can use statistics to ignore the sample-specific variation and find chemical differences related to what we're actually interested in, in this case age.
