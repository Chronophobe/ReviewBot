**ranger creek rimfire mesquite smoked texas single malt whiskey**

abv: 43%

**color:** [mesquite flowers.](http://www.druidswood.co.uk/images/mesquiteflowers.jpg)

**nose:** very floral. pretty harsh acrid alcoholic note.
 
**taste:** this is where someone who is drinking a peated whisky says peat, and it's the same with this mesquite smoked variety, only it's mesquite and lots of it. knowing not everyone has had the pleasure of mesquite smoked barbecue ribs, though, i'll try to describe what "mesquite" flavor is in other terms. there's a savory kind of sweetness but just a hint of spiciness. something you'd want to slather all over some chicken or ribs. there's also a chocolate-covered pecan flavor mixed in there. but i'm not talking super sweet here, just slightly. none of that harsh acrid nose is on the palate; it's very smooth.

**finish:** i'd swear my breath smells of flowers, but the police officers will probably say no, still alcohol. kind of spearminty.

so this is [ranger creek.](http://www.drinkrangercreek.com/)  my local store was doing a tasting, and i was intrigued by the description of a mesquite smoked single malt. it's a small batch aged in small casks and bottled in small bottles. aside from the nose, i'd say this was a successful purchase. a mesquite-bomb whiskey works out very well indeed. anyone out in texas should find themselves a bottle.

85/100
