you know what, i'm not even going to be rude. i'm sorry for the miscommunication, but that means i put my phone down to do my job. i'm pretty fuckin good at it, as well. wouldn't change it for the world right now. so what i intended to get across, is that yes, i'll be a bit distracted from my phone so i can do my job with as much pride as i usually do. and i'm not sure why talking about scotch, especially since i'm not moronic enough to drink on the job, means anything.
