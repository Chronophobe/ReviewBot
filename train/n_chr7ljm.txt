i found this bottle in my in law's basement, from what i can tell it's a wild turkey 101 proof with the 8 year old age statement from possibly 1980. for those who can't read that image, the bottle says:
l-1430
80
liquor bottle
32 p i
from what i could figure this is from 1980 given the 80 stamped on the bottle. there was no date anywhere on the bottles and no upc. the tax seal didn't have any dates on it either although it's possible that it faded. two questions, anyone have any idea how to identify this bottle's age and is this still good? it's been out of sunlight and is still sealed, looks like it has been stored upright and the cork even looks good from what i can tell. any help would be greatly appreciated!
