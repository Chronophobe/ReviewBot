**yamazaki 18**

while the yamazaki 12 isn't really my preferency in flavor profile, i recognized its quality, and gave it a nice rating. i was impressed by this whisky, but i was looking for something a little less honey-sweet. the yamazaki 18 had been on my mind even before the purchase of the 12, but i didn't want to risk the $110 price tag on something i might not care for. once again, this whisky has no cork, which i find surprising, but was expecting it after having the 12. this whisky is quite good, but like most 18 year whisky/scotch the flavor are subtle, and less exciting than a 15 year. this is not always a bad thing, as the flavor profile for this was very enjoyable.
