**crown royal xr**

crown royal xr (extra rare) is a canadian blended whisky. "this limited-release special blend of crown royal is sold in numbered bottles, and is made from the last batch of whiskey distilled at the waterloo distillery. after mothballing in 1992, the waterloo distillery burned down in 1993, with only a small amount of whisky being left behind."

back before i knew anything about whisky/scotch, and what a blended anything was, i purchased this bottle. i had been a long time crown drinker (a tradition passed down from my parents, and no we are not canadian, although in nh we are pretty close). i've had and owned at one time every version, including the horrid maple edition. i upgraded my parents from drinking the regular cr to the cr reserve, which seems to be a hot debate with the canadian whisky enthusiasts. 

anyways, i thought this was a really neat piece of history. i imagined brave firefighters rolling barrels out to save them. i imagined the malt master pouring bottles straight from the casks. i, stupidly, had assumed that this was 100% super awesome limited edition waterloo whisky.

whoops! much like the ink in the kiss comic books being made with the blood of the band members, i now picture each bottle has a single drop from some old moldy barrel from the dilapidated warehouse behind a burning distillery. sure this is an exaggeration in the other direction, but i wonder which fantasy is closer to the truth.

current bottles, the ones in the blue box, are no longer part of the waterloo batch (which are in a pink box), but are now part of the final batches of the lasalle distillery. at least i can rest assured that if i never finish this bottle i'll have the final drop from the waterloo distillery.

despite all of this, i actually do enjoy this whisky, although it is not worth the price, now that i have discovered scotch. because i am a completionist i will probably get the blue box xr. i do the occasional scotch swap over at /r/scotchswap if anyone is interested. what i like about this is how smooth and approachable it is. i can wave this around at fancy parties and no one will go away thinking "eww gross" however it is not all that exciting, it doesn't pop. it's like drinking cream soda, but i prefer root beer.
