booted from r/scotch for being merely a scotch-wannabe :-)

had to fix post - entitled "cape breton rare" on first try. cursed brain! (shaking fist)

**glen breton rare.** abv 43%. sampled neat. $85.00 usd

  

* **color:** straw (1/1)

* **nose:** floral, pear, mint. light. (28/33) 

* **palate:** soap! soft oak. something like depleted juicy fruit gum. difficult to detect specific notes. ordinarily a nice oily mouth feel that is off-putting with the soapiness.  (23/33)

* **finish:** long lingering soap! forest floor and baked apples. smooth. (21/33)

 

**scoring: 73/100** 

 

glenora distillery produces glen breton rare single malt whisky in glenville, nova scotia (glen, glen, glen...). they have pot stills imported from scotland, use scottish processes and employ personnel whose families are scottish. at one time they imported barley and, i think, peated malt from scotland. they paint their buildings white, call the nearby hills  "highlands" and point out in their promotional material that the locals speak gaelic. they were sued - unsuccessfully - by the scottish whisky association over the word "glen" in a decade long dispute that went all the way to the supreme court of canada. their 15 yr old release "battle of the glen" commemorates this victory.

 

note, however, that the bottle in the photo has no age statement (and a crooked neck). mine is the first batch from this newly-minted distillery. before it matured to the now standard 10 years, they released limited amounts at 8 and 9 years (with no age statement), and who could blame them? the distillery went broke twice while waiting for a return on investment.

 

my wife bought me this bottle for $75.00 cdn on a trip to canada in 2001, about a year after i started drinking whiskey. i had read some enthusiastic reviews in the canadian press and was really primed to try this ~~scotch~~ whisky. my wife and i are both newfoundlanders living in the southern us since 1993. newfies have a cultural affinity to our brethren in nova scotia so, in addition, i had a measure of patriotic pride for the "home team", so to speak. and this was my first sample of 'spensive stuff.

 

well... i instantly disliked it. back then i drank mostly glenlivet with ice and water but i tried the glen breton neat like i knew i was supposed to and then with ice and water but i could not warm up to it, much as i tried. the mistake i made - and some of you may relate - is i didn't blame the whisky at all. i thought it was too sophisticated for my palate. 

 

so for the longest time (as in years) i wasn't interested in branching out because i thought "good" sipping scotch was simply not to my taste. i probably missed many years of enjoyment as a result of this experience. but with hindsight i can now say i learned two things from this bottle.

 

the first is to trust your nose and not get caught up in the hype. i discovered much later that many, "credentialed" reviewers shared my impression of glen breton rare (with a few notable exceptions). we all have our preferences but it seems, at least to some extent, a scotch can be objectively good or bad.
 
 

the second is that quality scotch is not so easy to produce, like some step by step recipe you can write down and follow. it takes craftsmanship, mentoring and perhaps a century or so of refinement. now when i sample a favorite dram i actually feel a connection to history, place and artisans long since passed. to the uninitiated this all sounds like bullcrap, i'm sure.  

 

there is still hope for the good folks at glenora distillery. as long as somebody likes their product they will remain open and, with the right acumen, improve on it's appeal. [they are not there yet](http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/whiskey-profile/1244/glen-breton-rare), though, as far as i can tell, but i hope they do well. i'm seeing glen breton rare on the shelf of my local retailer for the first time which is why i wanted to review this now. if you see it where you are, i recommend you take a pass. 
 

**tl;dr** - weird prominent note of ivory soap.
