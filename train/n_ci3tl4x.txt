there have been rumors of this for a while. it appears it will only come in 375s. i assume it will be pricier than maker's 46. i had hoped the proof would be higher than 100. that seems pretty lame for "cask strength" but ttbs on proof don't have to be exact. 

edit - per sku: "proof is often just a placeholder, particularly for cask strength offerings. i would ignore the 50 proof."

edit 2 - per kyle @ angel's envy: "375 can change as well with out needing to refile the cola." so it looks like they might do 750s as well
