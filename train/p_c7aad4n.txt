ah, time for another irish dram. this time we've got the respected red breast 12. unlike the trader joe's irish whisky in the previous review, this whisky is of the pure pot still style and is triple distilled. so, this is a very, very irish whisky. looking forward to this one!

**redbreast 12**


**color:** amber +1

**abv:** 40%

**aroma neat:**

flint, toffee, graphite, dark cocoa powder, creamy cereal grains, copper, dark honey, figs, plums, rummy brown sugar, juicy raisins, apples, cinnamon, old cloves, toasted oak, wood pulp, rich caramel, vanilla, resin.

layer after layer of metallic, burnt sugar, and fruity notes. simply excellent and definitively pure pot still.

**aroma water:**

raisins, aromatic cinnamon, plums, nutmeg, molten caramel, flint, minerality, toasted oak, coal, cloves in honey, vanilla, raisins, dark brown sugar, stewed apples, cereal grains, malt barley, walnuts, roast almonds (slightly), clover honey.

wow. even at 40%, this whisky opens fantastically. there's so much going on it's hard to get one's bearings. i don't really even have to hunt for aromas, all eagerly and simultaneously present themselves in total harmony. great whisky.

**taste neat:**

dark honey, jamaican rum, muscovado sugar, raisins, soft oak/wood  pulp, light barrel char/charcoal, cinnamon sticks, dark honey, clove, apple.

hugely rum-raisin at first sip. spice, wood, and other fruits emerge later. extremely tasty, moderately sherried whisky, that still let's the spirit do some talking. no trace of sulfur either.

**taste water:**

honey, brown sugar, old toasted oak, cinnamon, wood pulp, browned/dehydrated apples, raisins, honey, muscovado sugar, rum.

excellent with water, though the palate doesn't benefit as much from a drop or two as the nose does.

**finish:**

flinty/mineralic, plum pits, walnut (slightly), toasty oak, dried cherries, tin/copper.

delicious, but not super long-lasting.

**conclusion:**

excellent in all regards.

**rating:** 90/100

incredibly rich, complex, and delicious whisky. whatever the midleton distillery is doing to make redbreast, they're doing it right.
