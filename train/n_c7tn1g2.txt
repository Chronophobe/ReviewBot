it bears no resemblance to whisky.  you could mix it in with any flavored vodka line up and not pick out the whisky.

it's not that it's *that* bad, it just shouldn't even have the word "whisky" on the bottle.

it's apples to oranges, i would be kicked out of /r/oranges if i tried to review a pink lady or granny smith.
