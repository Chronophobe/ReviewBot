not to my knowledge, but i would love to try one if it's around. as far as corn whiskey goes i've never had the mellow corn, but i have had the balcones, platte valley and kopper kettle. by far the kopper kettle was the best. they age it in apple wood barrels which gives it a great fresh apple finish.
