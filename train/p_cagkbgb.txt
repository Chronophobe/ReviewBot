**lot no. 40, 43% abv**

*single copper pot still canadian whisky. 90% rye, 10% malted rye.*

sample courtesy of tomodera.

* nose: sweet toffee and pine. soft spices, cereal and grain. turkish delight. cinnamon sugar and clove. maple syrup. canned lychees and peaches. spearmint gum.  a bit salty and peppery.

* taste: light bodied and silky smooth. vanilla fudge. cranberry juice and apple cider. creamy malt and grain. rosehip tea with honey. fresh mint and sweet basil. ripe citrus. toasted oak and cedar. faintly floral.

* finish: white pepper and light rye spices. butterscotch and maple. sweetened black tea. more floral notes. medium and bittersweet.

this is a very refined and delicate rye whisky. i'm used to much bolder and spicier american ryes, but once i got over my preconceptions i was able to enjoy this one. 

easy to drink and very enjoyable. same score as alberta premium dark horse.
