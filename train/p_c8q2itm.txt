**clontarf single malt irish whiskey, 40% abv, 50ml sample**

* nose: malty and sweet. ripe oranges and lemon rind. honeydew melon. menthol, basil and pine.

* taste: light and thin. a flash of sweetness that quickly disappears followed by ethanol burn. crisp barley, ginger and grapefruit skin. minty and bitter. tart, peppery and oaky.

* finish: pine, chilli, grass and eucalyptus. medium long and bitter. there is a strange minty warming sensation that's lingering at the back of my throat.

very piney, bitter and tart with hardly any sweetness in the taste and finish. unrefined and unbalanced, but  somewhat enjoyable and quite interesting. 

&gt;**67/100**
