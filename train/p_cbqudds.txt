**crown royal reserve, 40% abv**

thetrumpetplayer sent this to me as a mystery dram. the sneaky bastard... x-post from /r/scotch 

* nose: sweet, floral and piney. winey tannins. dried fig and dates. roasted nuts. cinnamon sugar. creme caramel. glace cherries, canned peaches and apricots.

* taste: light-medium bodied and smooth. potpourri. honey, choc almonds and fresh mint. crisp cereal notes (i don't know if i'm imagining this but i can almost taste some rye). lightly spiced towards the end. a bit of plastic.

* finish: sweet, herbal and minty finish. toasted rye sourdough. tannic oak and cedar. short and dry with lingering floral notes

very floral and sweet. simple and boring, but not bad.
