nant single malt: port cask #14

special thanks to ayedfy for this sample!

colour: fools gold

nose: crisp green apples, ever-so-slight sea spray and light cured meat.

palate: light and more apples. hard to actually believe this is a port cask! hard candy and slightly oily prunes. 

finish: oh ok here's the port cask! here is the port finish. a little 'cottony' and with that unmistakable australian 'ember' like a cindering campfire with marshmallows and some toasted damper.


in conclusion, this is totally not what i thought would be in the vial. i was kinda expecting a much darker musty dram for some reason. nant is a bit of a dark horse to me as their bottles don't get you much change out of $200 and are 500ml/50cl. hard to plunge at those prices without a taste. many thanks to ayedfy for this swap from a little while back (just getting around to some now!). there's some really stunning character to this that i can't quite lay a finger on.


score: 84/100
