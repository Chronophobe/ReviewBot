*[the new zealand doublewood 10.](http://danmurphys.com.au/media/dm/product/750x2000/385079_0_9999_v1_m56577569853217524.jpg) new zealand blended whisky, aged 10 years in a combination of american oak and french pinot noir barrels, and bottled at 40% abv. local bottle price: $80 for 750ml.*

**nose:** the nose is showing a strong wine influence. juicy raisins, dark plums, alcoholic fruitcake. touch of nuttiness, with walnuts, pistachios, even pecan. dessert sweet and very rich.

**palate:** soft and velvety smooth on the palate, body sitting comfortably at medium. more red dessert wine sweetness, although a little one-note now, losing a lot of the complexity from the nose. cherries, dried apricots, lathered in fresh honey.

**finish:** warm, buttery toast. interesting (and delicious) at first, but disappointingly short. falls away far too quickly, leaving only hints of the red wine darting around in the distance a few seconds in, before even those disappear completely.

it tastes like it's been diluted far too much for its own good, which is a shame since there are so many exciting flavours just waiting to burst out (as showcased on that divine nose). definitely a good whisky, and a worthy choice for the price (this comes in around the same price as the basic wine-finished glenmorangies, for example), but ultimately frustrating for the enthusiast yearning to taste this unique whisky presented at a proper strength.

they have a couple of cask-strength expressions that might be interesting, albeit incredibly expensive.

**82/100**
