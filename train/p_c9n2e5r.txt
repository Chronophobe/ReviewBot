&gt;lark single malt whisky is the flagship product of the lark distillery. first produced in small quantities in 1992, it is distilled from tasmanian (franklin) barley, malted at the cascade brewery. the whisky is lightly peated (approximately 50% of the malt is peated) and resembles in flavour a scottish speyside or highland whisky.

&gt;the whisky is double distilled in locally crafted potted stills and it is only the “honey sweet” heart of the run which is kept for barrelling in 100 litre oak casks. it is matured up to eight years in the smaller barrels which have a much larger surface area-to-volume of liquid. this allows a faster rate of evaporative losses and a considerably shorter maturation period than that required with the larger barrels used in scotland.

* nose: sweet and clean barley notes. cereal, fresh lemons and green apples. dry white wine. honey, vanilla and berries. wet wood and campfire smoke. faint earthiness in the background. doesn't smell like a port matured whisky.

* taste: light-medium bodied and velvety smooth. diluted honey, orange peel and dry oak. pepper and ginger. marzipan with vanilla cream. lemony, briny and herbaceous towards the finish.

* finish: malty, earthy and woody. dry oak. floral honey and salted pine nuts. medium and pleasant, leaving a warm tingly spiciness at the back of my throat.

this one is supposed to be peated but i didn't get any peat. this is also supposed to port matured but i didn't get any porty notes. very strange. 

still a very good aussie whisky with a refreshing and clean flavour profile, almost like a bourbon matured lowland scotch.
