**hakushu 12, 43.5% abv, 50ml sample**

*japanese single malt*

* nose: honey and sweet barley. citrus, crisp apples and pears. pineapple, mint and cereal. vanilla panna cotta. faint incense and wood smoke. 

* taste: light, but satisfactory. sour pineapple and sweet cream. young coconut and green mango. light pepper and spices. more honey and salted toffee. charred oaky dryness.

* finish: a bit grassy, but sweet. cereal and malt. faint earthy smokiness. medium and pleasant. tannic and dry.

this is a very refined and delicate dram. i normally gravitate towards big and bold whiskies but i really enjoyed this one. better than yamazaki 12.
