i was part of a 5 hour bourbon making class at new deal distillery in portland, or this weekend.  it was put on by the distillery's owner and master distiller, tom berkleaux.


we covered the process of making bourbon, the different types of whiskeys, the function of the still, and a bunch of other topics.  then we made up a mash (high rye bourbon mash, hooray!)  it is fermenting right now, and in a couple of weeks i'll be able to get a bottle of the white dog, which i plan on aging in my personal-sized cask.  in 6-18 months i can go get another bottle of any of their maturing bourbons, or, i can wait until my personal batch has matured.  i'll likely pick up an interim bottle (cost included as part of the class), then buy mine from my barrel when it is complete.
