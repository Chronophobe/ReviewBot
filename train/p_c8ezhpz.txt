i got these as samples for $5 each, which was a deal too good to pass up. i finally got my tastebuds returned to working condition after a nasty scalding, and thought i'd celebrate with a double review. i'm a little drunk. 

**review #8 - amrut single malt whisky** *product of india, 46% abv*

* **color -** straw to medium urine
* **look -** coats the glass evenly. slow, slow legs.
* **nose -** apple juice, green leaves, latex paint, molasses, wet pavement, light brown sugar, rose blossoms. floral, light, fruity.
* **taste -** thin in the mouth. initial bitterness. tastes like carpet. dry, salty apples. just-raked-leaves-dust-in-your-mouth-taste. faint lemon zest, coriander, black pepper.
* **finish -** lingering dryness, salty &amp; sour. tiny alcohol tingle, but quite smooth. a little gravel or something. closes with molasses/brown sugar.

this has so many elements of my childhood, it's scary. i grew up in rural ohio, where it constantly rains/is nasty out, the roads are always under construction, and you spend every weekend from september through november outside raking leaves (or jumping into piles of them to piss of your folks.) truly, i wouldn't expect the average scotchitter to enjoy this as much as i did, as my enjoyment was largely based on nostalgia. **overall - 85/100**

**review #9 - amrut fusion single malt whisky** *product of india, 50% abv*

* **color -** golden wheat/apple juice
* **look -** coats glass, legs take forever to form, and are dead slow.
* **nose -** dark caro syrup, toasted pecan, caramelized grilled peach, seriously, though, pecan pie. slight savory meatiness - spiced rubbed pork/bacon?
* **taste -** thick sweetness. nutty pecan and molasses. amazing richness without any cloying sweetness. salted caramel in chocolate. something really slight and meaty/smoky... bacon? carnitas? fairly thick in mouth.
* **finish -** medium long, rich, warm. "that's an easy 50%!" slight oak and charcoal. a bit of fruit at the end - blackberries. medium-dry.

i'm in love here. it struck me as a great introduction to scotch for a bourbon drinker, but it is so much more. it caught me by surprise, and really impressed me. i will definitely buy a full bottle of this post haste. **overall - 94/100**

**note:** i was taken aback tonight. i truly didn't know what to expect with these two drams. i'd never had anything from india before, although i've had quite a few scotches and bourbons. the first, although not my favorite dram, took me on a tour of my own childhood, bringing memories i haven't had in years back to the forefront of my mind. the second brought me back into the present, giving me a beautiful blend of all my favorite things (for those of you who don't know, i'm a pecan pie junky.)

i feel like i just experienced *a christmas carol* via whisky... i'm just looking for the ghost of whisky yet to come at this point... any suggestions?

from a drunken cincinnatian, i love you all, and i'm so grateful to have you in my fake internet life! cheers!
