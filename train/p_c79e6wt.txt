hello, hello! back with another review after a bit of a break (i have too many opened bottles i need to finish to justify opening something new). i'd seen this and figured i'd try it on a whim as i hadn't had any gibson's whisky previously. 
this expression of gibson's finest was created with "a hint of maple" in order to celebrate the 100th grey cup, canada's annual football championship.

country/region: ontario, canada

age: nas

40% abv, $30/750ml

**body and colour**

* amber and quite lightly bodied. i'd bet my hat that there's colouring in this.

**nose**

* *neat:* on first inspection this smells like a black sharpie. on second glance, there is indeed a hint of maple syrup in there, but it can be lost among the rather unfortunate medicinal, grain alcohol smell. 

* *diluted:* table syrup. still a slight chemical smell to it.

**palate**

* *neat:* a sharp alcohol bite. slight sweetness. i presume that's the maple? just tastes like sugar to me. 

* *diluted:* slightly sugary. grain alcohol. meh.

**finish**

* *neat:* rolling warmth down the throat and on the tongue. sharp, peppery bite on the tip of your tongue. short, but intense. no really impressive flavours in it, unfortunately. some pepper, but it tastes, again, like grain alcohol.

* *diluted:* none, really. mild, bitter chemical taste on your tongue. very short.

i'll be mixing the rest of this bottle, i think. young, sharp, and unsophisticated. the maple is certainly in there, but it just doesn't seem to work aside from the bit you get in the nose, but even that was overpowered by that unfortunate marker smell at first. that bizarre chemical taste on the tongue isn't doing this harsh whisky any favors. as i was looking forward to trying a maple whisky this one left me utterly disappointed. 

score: 45 - skip this. would have been a higher score (it's an average young whisky, all things considered) but that dreadful chemical-ness knocked it down a peg or two.
