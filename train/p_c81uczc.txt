**nikka taketsuru 21**  

**abv:** 43%  

**region:** japan (malt blend)

**nose:** this is a nose that booms out, not shy at all.  "here i am!"  my nose is actually backed off about 4 inches from my glencairn.  thick sherry.  there's something a bit deeper about the wood in here, reminiscent of a fruitier bourbon... a charred oakiness.  furnature polish, cigars, wood, orange oil, fresh stained wood, old banana, wood, and a little more charred wood.  almost forgot wood.  is that soy sauce too?

**taste:** woody sherry.  cherry syrup, orange rind, and oak tannin.  you sort of get used to the wood after a sip or two, and holding it in your mouth brings out more fruit notes.

**finish:** tannin filled, with light fruity sherry notes.  a bit of bitter apple skin with some strawberries and cherries in syrup.  this is pretty overpowered by wood, with a tail of cigar tobacco and dry leather.  still there are complex and old sweet fruit notes that are pretty nice.

**final notes:** i sort of feel like i just ate a couple cigars.  i think someone snuck a strawberry in there.  a bit too woody for me, but still brings some nice stuff to the table.  underneath all the wood is a complex sherry nature that one would expect from an older malt.  this gets a few points off for "over-casking" sadly.  it certainly isn't ruined, but the wood is extremely overpowering.  quite educational actually, i haven't had a malt yet that i felt was overpowered by wood until this one.  there are still quite nice aspects to this malt, but coming from a man who loves tannins and old sherry malts, this is just a little bit too much.

**final score: 90/100**
