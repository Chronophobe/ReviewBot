crown royal maple â€“ a review

i initially dismissed crown royal maple as just another flavored whisky (like many that are drowning in honey, cherry, vanilla, etc) but then i read it was "finished" with maple wood, and thought it was worth a go. however, more research would indicate it is finished with "maple toasted oak" not actual maple wood. i don't know what "maple toasted oak" is, but, it doesn't belong in whisky.

this stuff smells like candy. it's a charred (almost burnt) maple/caramel aroma. the taste starts oddly thin, but, then is syrupy vanilla and maple syrup. long finish that starts with a little burnt wood, but, progresses to light maple syrup and a vague vanilla-ish chemically flavor.

i was duped on this one, and probably should not have bought it. i could see people enjoying it, possible mixed with root beer or cream soda perhaps? or, you know, on pancakes? at the end of the day this is really just liquid candy at 40% abv. i just can't call it whisky, and because of that, it gets ~~**0/100**~~ a **dnq**.

**edit** -- instead of 0/100 i have changed it to a dnq (does not qualify). i cannot score this as a whisky.
