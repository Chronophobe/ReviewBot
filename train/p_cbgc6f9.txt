**eye:** a very warm and inviting caramel

**nose:** brown sugar and honey, almost a baklavah like quality, but with something more fresh hiding inside.

**taste:**freaking delicious. it has an array of earth toned flavors ranging from brow sugar and caramel to a very pleasant, but almost hidden woodiness (splinters of flavor) with a spicy earthy finish.

**feel:** rich, velvety and comforting. warm.

**finish:**  smooth with something in the aftertaste that reminds me of raspberries and strawberries, but not exactly them. like an impression of them.
