i received these two minis from a friend who went to ireland and knew i like whiskey. these will be my first reviews for /r/worldwhisky. there is only one review of the single malt and no reviews of the 70 in the archive.

name: the irishman 70

abv: 40%
age statement: none

the irishman 70 appears to be named as such because it is 70% malt and 30% grain whiskey.

nose: pepper, vanilla, more alcohol than i've come to expect from a 80 proof whiskey. 

palate: light, vanilla, bit of chocolate

finish: kinda short but hangs out long enough to note a sweet wood.

conclusion: this is a decent blend, but nothing i would buy a full bottle of. **70/100**

------------------------

name: the irishman single malt

abv: 40%
age statement: none

nose: vanilla, orange

palate: orange, malt, vanilla

finish: smokey wood, medium length

conclusion: this is actually pretty good. i didn't find it to be very complex, but at least it tasted good. maybe it's benefiting from the fact that i just reviewed jw red. i'll give it an **82/100**
