of the major canadian whisky brands—the others being, i would suggest, cc, crown, wiser’s, and alberta premium (with forty creek on their heels, and with the less said about black velvet or canadian mist the better)—perhaps the least talked about is gibson’s. which is interesting for at least a couple reasons: one being that one of canadian whisky’s dirty little secrets is that (to my knowledge) gibson’s these days is mostly (though not exclusively) contract-manufactured in the same place as cc and wiser’s (the hiram walker facility in windsor). 

but the other is that, in terms of global brand pedigree, gibson’s is in fact maybe the most interesting: not only are they owned by william grant &amp; sons (the makers of glenfiddich, the balvenie, tullamore dew and others), but as part of that arrangement, grant’s head distiller brian kinsman is now, also, technically in charge of gibson’s warehouse stock and their flavour profile. that means he’s had a hand in guiding new whiskies, though it’s not like he can go back in time and change the flavour profile of the brand’s long extent-entries.

gibson’s finest 12 year old is one of those entries, the brand’s flagship—or previous flagship, until they introduced a cheaper whisky, sterling, in the 1980s to deal with a shortage of appropriately aged juice. thus, having (curiously) never tried a gibson’s whisky before, it seemed like an appropriate place to start. so i picked up a couple mini bottles while making some other purchases, and what follow are my first reactions.

**gibson’s finest canadian whisky**, aged 12 years; 40% abv; i am drinking from a 50ml glass mini-bottle, but a full-750ml bottle costs about $32 cdn. in alberta

**appearance:** somewhere between deep gold and copper.  decent body for a lower abv whisky.

**nose:**  somewhat closed. a fairly typical mainstream canadian whisky nose. a bit prickly. vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, toasted oak, faint maple syrup. there are gestures toward something else—something interesting, or unique—but they’re only hints and they’re elusive. just a hint of dusty rye. mineral water. there’s almost like a . . . chlorinated quality? sweet and sour candy. honey. distant floral notes (heather?). faintly chemical. nothing bad, but really nothing stands out. mild. just a single drop of water bumps up the vanilla and the maple, but also suggests some spices (cloves, cinnamon) lingering around the edges. time also helps this one—it magnifies some of the rounded edges of the sweetness and spice—but no amount of time’s going to turn it into a better spirit.

**taste:** i like the oily, velvety mouthfeel, and the soft heat of this one, but flavour-wise it’s more of the same. vanilla, butterscotch, some fresh and toasted oak. citrus. maybe the faintest hint of cinnamon and cloves? a tiny bit of rye. just a single drop of water actually seems to tie things together fairly nicely, bringing together the oak and the vanilla and the spices into a nice smooth blend, but you’ll never mistake this for a bold, strongly flavoured whisky.

**finish:** short-to-medium, the finish being canadian whisky’s typical weakness in general. but not unpleasant—toasted oak and apples, a gentle-but-assertive warmth. 

**final thoughts:** a nice, smooth, inexpensive and inoffensive canadian whisky. it doesn’t really do anything special, and it’s not going to turn heads, but it does the fairly typical canadian whisky profile in a pretty respectable way. by the same token, however, i’m not entirely certain i could pick this out in a line-up from several other similarly priced, similarly aged canadian whiskies produced by different companies under different brands (especially, not surprisingly, some of the ones that are also currently being made at the hiram walker facility). worth a try if you’re already a canadian whisky convert, but ultimately it’s nothing special. 

**score:** 79
