**starward single malt, 43% abv**

sample courtesy of the18thelement.

this is a 3yo australian single malt from victoria (ugh). i really like the bottle and label.

* nose: oranges. resinous pine and eucalyptus. bitter oaky tannins. vanilla and charcoal. freshly laundered upholstery. apple vinegar. ripe citrus and fresh peach. flowers. more orange.

* taste: medium bodied and sharp.. simple and sweet with some citric tartness. oranges. orange peel. [jaffas.](http://i.imgur.com/nlut4l0.jpg) orange oil. orange juice concentrate. a hint of lime. ethanol.

* finish: orange peel... maybe mandarin peel. honey sweetness with pine and eucalyptus. a pinch of white pepper. dry oak. medium and not bad.

solid first effort. a bit too simple for me. if you like citrus you'd love this.

&gt;**76/100**
