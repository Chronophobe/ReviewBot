esoterica:
this was a reddit user suggestion from my post the other day.  in the end i couldn't have been happier with the decision. it's such an experience that i suggest sitting down in a comfortable chair, lest it plant you square on your arse. the bouquet that you get from the nose alone is just so complex it's almost indescribable. just let it breathe and open up like the orchid that it is. just let it take its time with you. just when you think you've had enough another flavor develops just to surprise you. almost like a mobster named harry houdini was working you over. this is not a dram for the beginner though as it might lead to sensory overload and maybe a bad experience. but with time i believe every serious whiskey drinker should give this dram a go. just pour and let the journey begin. 

.
look:
dark sultry and foreboding deep ruddy amber. with a thickness that just hangs on the glass

.
nose:
plum geckkian, orange zest, cranberries, sweet malty raisin bran cereal, peppermint, banana, vanilla and old oak.

.
taste:
such a massive assault of favors
cherries, plums, mulling spices, old medieval church (that old oaken and mahogany smell that only old resinous wood found in churches has), orange marmalade, vanillin, currants (red), slightly bright citrus note just before you get hit with the truncheon of flavor from the base, ginger and spicy red chilies. 

.
finish:
all favors give way in time to the resinous church wood favors. until even they subside and plum jam takes over.  it almost seems like this dram just doesn't want to let go. it just hangs on forever lingering on your tongue.
