well, this is going to be fun.

stars black whisky is part of the stars portfolio, [the “house brand” of cheap spirits sold at liquor depot stores in alberta](http://liquorstoresgp.ca/specials/alberta/6greatspiritsunder20.aspx). their big selling point? price (there’s a couple of vodkas, a couple of whiskies, and a couple of rums, and they all go for about $20 cdn.). their big drawback? they taste fucking horrendous. 

that said, i had a friend to pour me a sample from his bottle of this stuff (it was a lean, lean month for him), because i thought it might be worth a laugh.

stars black whisky is also, if it’s any further disincentive to buy the stuff, made by minhas distillery—a part of the minhas brewing empire that’s become well-known up here in alberta for all the wrong reasons: a company that’s currently collecting an alberta small-brewer tax credit despite the fact that the vast majority of their beer (and all of their spirit) is currently being made in wisconsin (in fact, their wisconsin facility is actually the 14th largest brewery in the entire united states). which, incidentally, makes the actual nature of this stars black whisky even more confusing—it’s ostensibly “canadian whisky,” except it’s made in wisconsin (it doesn’t appear to be sourced), though the provincial liquor database lists it as being imported from ontario. so it may or may not actually be canadian whisky.

[oh, and did i mention minhas apparently funnel most of their profits to the caribbean to avoid paying taxes in canada, after having benefitted from that alberta small-brewer tax credit? seriously, fuck them.](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/david-menzies/minhas-brewery_b_1270464.html)

anyway . . .

**stars black whisky**; 50% abv (well, that’s something, at least); aged 3 years (never mind that that’s the absolute minimum canadian whisky has to be aged for anyway); this comes from a sample bottle set aside by a friend, but a full 750ml bad boy will run you a whole $20 cdn. in alberta. i’d show you a picture of the actual bottle, but it literally *cannot* be found on the internet, which doesn’t bode well. not even the minhas website wants to take credit for this stuff.

**appearance:** standard artificial amber colouring. thin body. have to say i’m surprised—i was half expecting an actual, ludicrous, black-food-coloured whisky, but it seems the “black” here is meant more in the way of trying to rip of crown royal black and the new trend of bigger, higher-abv canadian whiskies.

**nose:** yellow cornmeal, flour, cinnamon, and pure ethanol. harsh graininess. varnish/paint thinner. stale beer. sour? like if they made a butterscotch-flavoured mr. clean? light, wet, soggy cardboard. faint sickly sweetness, almost like a splenda-type artificial sweetener. sour apple juice from concentrate, left out in the sun and beginning to ferment. legitimately turns my stomach.

**taste:** thin, hot, cinnamon. sour, stale beer. somehow watery and alcoholic at the same time. artificial vanilla. splenda. holy fuck, i legitimately just gagged (twice). wet wood. again, fucking *cornmeal*. alcohol. bad vodka. spoiled orchard fruits. that layer you skim off the top of soup that’s been sitting too long. salty? oh my god, this is the worst thing i’ve ever tasted in my life, whisky or otherwise. christ, it tastes like fermented apple juice left to age in soggy cardboard boxes.

**finish:** sour. soggy cardboard. cornmeal. grainy. woodchips? short but still entirely too long.

**final thoughts:** what. the. fuck. this may be the worst whisky i’ve ever tasted. i’ve said a few times on this subreddit that i don’t really give scores below 50 because even the worst mainstream whiskies are still made to a certain standard of quality control. to some extent, i still stand by that claim, because this is not a mainstream whisky, but this is just horrendous (and ought to be sampled by everyone who is so quick to assign a sub-50 rating to dewar’s or cc or johnnie walker red). having had this, i will never complain about canadian club or its ilk again. i’m not even sure i can be friends with the guy whose conscience actually allowed him to *give* me a sample.

**score:** 1 (because i didn’t go blind)
