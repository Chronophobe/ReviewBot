another port-matured aussie malt? sign me up. this one was the first whisky released by the now-closed southern coast distillery in south australia. thanks to uncletobys for the sample!
 
*[southern coast distillers museum release batch 001.](http://i.imgur.com/cetip.jpg) australian single malt, distilled in 2007, matured in an american oak ex-port cask, and bottled in 2010 at 46%. bottle price: $120 for 700ml.*

**nose:** dense port character; rich fruitcake, caramel, black plums, and sweet malty vanilla. honey-sweetened white coffee. uncletobys mentions a certain brandy aspect, which i can understand with the presence of fresh grapes and juicy pears.

**palate:** warm and full-bodied. apricots, winey cherries and plums, and vanilla bean announce the powerful influence the port cask has had on this whisky over such a short period of time. added spiciness with ground peppercorns and raw cocoa.

**finish:** malt, malt, malt. milk chocolate. more peppercorns with a touch of gingerbread and spicy dry oak added to the sweet port profile. there's also the addition of a herbal element; basil, with the most delicate hint of garlic. long, dry, complex.

while all the port-matured aussies have a broadly similar flavour that is uniquely different from the scottish port-matured whiskies i've tasted, this especially reminds me of the port-matured expressions from sullivans cove. while unlikely, perhaps southern coast sourced their casks from the same winery as the sullivans cove producers? this was certainly more oaky and dry than the sullivans cove i've had. better balance, more subtle and multi-dimension complexity. undoubtedly a well-crafted whisky, even by the high standards set by other australian distillers.

i wish these guys kept making whisky, but i'm glad i got the chance to taste some of it while it was around.

**94/100**
