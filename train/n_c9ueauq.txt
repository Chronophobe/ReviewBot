i have to admit that i'm pretty happy to see lot no. 40 get its due in the canadian whisky category, and it's interesting that the award for best rye went to a whiskey distilled in canada, given the lack of respect canadian whisky-makers get (and the resurgence of rye in the us).

also curious how jim beam devil's cut is the best straight bourbon.
