**st george single malt lot 11 from st. george spirits**

* color: light golden honey color, looks like a white wine

* nose: sweet candy smell, cherry with hints of vanilla and lemon.

* taste: intensely floral right from the start. tasted a little hoppy so i added a few drops of water which drastically changed the taste. still hoppy and slightly nutty across the tongue with a hint of smoky cinnamon

* finish: smokiness gave way to oak and tobacco. smoke and oak flavors seemed to build the longer it sat. smoky flavor sort of lingers on the palette with a hint of spice, almost like taking a few puffs from a cigar.

* overall: i did not expect it to taste like this at all, i've never tasted a whiskey like this, and adding a few drops of water completely opened it up. it was so smooth and sweet at the start i wasn't expecting anything bold. it was crazy how the boldness sort evolved, starting off like ipa hops which became smokey. it really surprised me because just as i began to notice the smokiness, it became very oaky like a dark stout beer. and it lingered on the palette like a cigar, but in a nice way. the glass smelled like the inside of an oak barrel when i was done. this is one of the two best american craft whiskeys i've ever had (the other being lion's pride 47th ward) but i don't have a clear favorite because of how different the two are. unfortunately it's very, very hard to get st. george's lot 11 now and lot 12 has more of a dry flavor that kind of lingers from start to finish. hopefully i find another bottle of this because you have to drink it several times to really appreciate the unique flavor profiles. i imagine it will be a long time before i find another exciting whiskey like this.

90/100
