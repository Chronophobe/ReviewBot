hello ww, texacer here with another world review.  i'm "vacationing" in canada so to speak.  i mentioned to another redditor that i was lost with canadian whisky and that i have yet to try one that didn't taste like maple syrup... so **alberta premium 80 proof**


* color: yellow
* nose: big maple syrup pancakes with melted butter on top. 
* taste: super sweet maple and butter.  midly acidic.  
* finish: smooth and sugar

maple syrup.  really.  i guess that's what they like there?  i want something different, interesting.  it's hard not to grade this by bourbon or scotch scales i use but it's just so one note.
