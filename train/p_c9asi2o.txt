good morning, /r/worldwhisky! several /r/scotchswaps ago i received a botle of yamazaki 12 from /u/uncletobys. i decided to crack it open and give it a try, so here's my first review on /r/worldwhisky!

**yamazaki 12**

*price:* n/a

*color:* whisky.

*region:* japan

*abv*: 43%

*nose:* tropical fruits, oak, honey, cinnamon, and more fruit.

*palate:* sherry, vanilla, toffee. it's a bit salty, but not in a bad way. stil picking up fruity notes, more dried fruits than the nose.

*finish:* mild to medium finish. dry spice and barley at first with a finish of floral fruityness.

**80/100**

i liked it. it's not my favorite, but i don't hate it. i'd buy a bottle on sale, or to give to a friend that likes whisky and may not have tried it, but overall it's a mid-level enjoyable drink that i'm happy to have sampled.
