greetings ww, texacer here with another quick review.  i received a bottle of **tullamore dew 80 proof** as a xmas present from a co-worker because he knew i "liked scotch".  okay then.


* color: light wood
* nose: light oak, mild tang.  paper
* taste: vanilla cookies. mild sour. flour.  hints of marshmallow. unsalted butter.
* finish: smooth and light

most irish i find lacking.  triple distillation can make a lot of whiskies soft.  this isnt a bad thing when done right.  there's nothing wrong with this whisky but theres also nothing memorable.  i have actually been using this as a palate warmer-upper before i review other whiskies.
