after thoroughly enjoying the [forty creek copper pot reserve](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/1hbz4f/review_forty_creek_copper_pot_reserve/), i figured it was time to give a shot to some of forty creek’s more upscale bottling—their annual, limited edition specialty offerings. here we have the forty creek confederation oak reserve. the gimmick here, according forty creek owner and master distiller john k. hall, was the use of canadian oak trees for a portion of the whisky’s maturation. which may not sound like much, but apparently that’s highly unusual: canadian whisky uses almost exclusively either new or used american oak (to the point where there *were* no canadian coopers hall could use to turn his canadian oak trees into barrels). hall’s thought process was that—though canadian oak is the same species as its southern neighbour—the northern climate might uniquely influence its growth and character.

**forty creek confederation oak reserve**; no age statement; lot 1867-b, bottle no. 05277; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $65 cdn. in the province of alberta

**appearance:** amber or deep gold. spotty legs, which is attributable to the low abv, no doubt. and while i generally enjoy the forty creek branding, i have to point out that the box and bottle here look rather cheaply made (especially that silly glued-on plastic medallion). that obviously doesn’t impact on what’s inside, but considering the forty creek special releases are amongst the most expensive canadian whiskies there are, *period*, one would think they’d up their game on the presentation side of things.

**nose:** initially very closed. with my first few glasses, i was worried that i’d just bought a slightly less sweet, slightly richer bottle of the copper pot reserve at more than twice the price. but over time, things do open up considerably. toffee, butterscotch, vanilla (big vanilla), but augmented by a really significant rye spiciness that’s just great. cinnamon hearts, clove. orange peel? baking rye bread. a nice dense (?), fresh woodiness. berries. tobacco? really, really nice, but i can’t help but think the abv is holding this one back from greatness.

**taste:** a bit thin, but otherwise very good. smooth, soft, sweet vanilla and caramel with a nice, fairly soft rye spiciness. a bit of sour as well. pepper. cinnamon. fresh cut lumber and sawdust. cinnamon, some vague fruitiness. is there some distant smoke? hmm. butterscotch. again, tobacco? good (and it pulls back on the over-the-top sweetness of many canadian whiskies considerably), but not on par with the nose, and again it’s really hurt by the abv.

**finish:** decent length, and a nice mix of sweet and dry. dry wood. vanilla. butterscotch. bit of rye spice lingers on the tongue.

**final thoughts:** recognizably a canadian whisky, but also different (albeit it in a fairly nebulous way that mostly has to do with a nice fresh woodiness). well-made, and really tasty, and with some notes i haven’t really encountered before—but it’s held back by that 40% abv presentation. don’t get me wrong, i really do like this stuff. it’s approaching (but not quite at) the top-tier of canadian whiskies i’ve tried. it’s much, much better than even the super-premium cc or crown royal bottles. and it’s certainly better than its younger sibling, the forty creek copper pot reserve. but (here's the caveat) not actually by *that* much, and it might in some ways be a less interesting whisky (the copper pot is younger, no doubt, and sweeter to the point of becoming a bit cloying over time, but i *really* like the big, young rye flavour it shows off). it’s certainly not twice as good, as the price differential might imply. bottle this one at 46% next time around, and i’ll be back for another go—otherwise it just doesn't seem worth it.

**score:** 86
