right up front, let me mention i am not an irish whiskey connoisseur by any stretch. this is only the second bottle i've ever purchased, the first being a bottle of powers that ended poorly. i bought this and another, a soon-to-be-reviewed bottle of bushmill's 21. 

the juice itself is triple distilled single malt, aged 12 years in bourbon casks. bottled at a measly 40%.

- **nose:** on the nose i get a light, citrusy-mango scent. some vanilla comes through, but not what i'd expect from a bourbon-aged whisky. pretty significant cereal notes as well. 
- **palate:** so light, a ton of lemon over a malty, spicy body. i get a clove and mango taste right in the middle of my palate as well. definitely sweet, light, and oily. 
- **finish:** a subtle jolt of spicy mango, then a lingering short-bready cereal note.

well then, hello ireland! i enjoyed this, a huge departure from the whiskey i normally drinkâ€¦ it's not in your face like a peated scotch or a big bourbon. delicate, subtle, very well made. lovely!
