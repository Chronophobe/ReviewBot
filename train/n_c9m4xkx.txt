after finishing up a bottle of red breast 12 (review pending), i was cruising on the distillery website and saw they had a members area for fans to sign up. two weeks later, boom! free swag from midleton. 

* a nice letter from the distillery
* a keychain
* an amazing whiskey tasting notebook with lots of room to write your tasting notes and an expansive history on irish whiskey and the distillery.

if you want your own, sign up on http://singlepotstill.com!
