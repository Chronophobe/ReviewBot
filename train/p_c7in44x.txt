home for christmas. rummaging through the parents’ liquor cabinet. christmas is time for family . . . and their booze.

canadian club classic is the oldest and most prestigious of the three standard canadian club bottling (the other two being the standard six-year old and a 10-year old). they’ve also got other, older and more exotic bottlings (in the 20-30 year range, plus a few high-proof or interesting finishes), but these three are in a respectable entry-level price range, and are generally considered the standards (along with crown royal) of canadian whisky (not that i necessarily agree they should get to be the standard-bearers).

canadian club classic 12 year old; 12 years old; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $27 cdn. in ontario and alberta, putting it right in the midst of the standard entry-level cdn. whisky brands.

**appearance:** perfect amber, which of course screams caramel colouring, but whatever. bottle is nice.

**nose:** maple syrup, vanilla, burnt sugars. maybe raisin and other dark fruits. bit of an alcohol prickle. sweet. some rye spice that’s nice. creamy. respectable, but not anything mind-blowing. a bit of water takes the edge off, and kicks up the oaky vanilla-maple, at the expense of some of the more interesting rye-like character. that vanilla actually gets more pleasant and well-rounded as it sits in the glass for a bit.

**taste:** a bit alcoholic. sweet. something off at first, but it collects itself. warm, mild spice. some rye. maple syrup. toffee? burnt sugar. bit of pepper. bit of citrus? water, as with the nose, takes the alcohol down a notch, and kicks up the sweetness, but also a bit of the grain as well—rye, maybe giving off a bit of ginger and nutmeg, christmas spices. admittedly more likeable as i get further into the glass.

**finish:** short. vanilla-butterscotch-maple oakiness. bit of rye spice, which is nice. alternating sweet and dry.

**final thoughts:** different from—but about on par (maybe a teensy bit better)—with crown royal limited edition, though fortunately for $15 or so less. pleasant, sippable, smooth. but nothing tremendously special. the price may make it worth a try, even if this isn’t one i’d actively seek out again.

unless, you know, it’s freely available in my parents’ liquor cabinet again.

**final score:** 81/100
