**nikka yoichi 10, 45% abv, 50ml sample**

* nose: honey and citrus. faint ethanol... a bit grainy. smokey and flinty. dried apricots, apples and pineapple. vanilla essence. a little buttery/oily. strawberry jam. resinous wood.

* taste: medium bodied and slightly viscous. sweet malt, dried herbs and light earthy peat.. eucalyptus and menthol. prune juice with a pinch of salt. candied orange peel. pipe tobacco. a bit peppery and spicy.

* finish: honey and lemon rind. tobacco spice. a bit herbal and earthy. medium and slightly bitter. 

nice whisky but a bit young. i like the smokiness and the tobacco notes. the light earthy peatiness is also interesting for a japanese whisky. 

&gt;**83/100**

thanks to hello_nasty for the sample!

* nose: honey and citrus. salted toffee. still getting some faint ethanol graininess (not unpleasant). flint and rock salt. ripe stone fruits and pineapple. banana essence and vanilla beans.

* taste: medium bodied and slightly oily. wood smoke, cigar smoke and light peatiness. creme brulee and salted butter. a bit sappy and syrupy. dry charred oak. liquorice, ginger and green mango with chilli-salt.

* finish: charred oak, liquorice and orange peel. cinnamon and clove. sweet tobacco. medium-long and a bit spicy.

this whisky is fantastic, the best japanese i've had. the extra 5 years in the barrel has improved it greatly.

&gt;**90/100** (my first 90+ japanese whisky)
