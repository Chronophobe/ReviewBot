way cool!  thanks for replying. a few more questions please:

what do you do as a drink professional?  

what other judgings have you done?

during the judging where were the whiskies from other distilleries such as laphroiag? glenfarclas? bruichladdich? glenmorangie? spingbank?etc?  were they not tasted?  

how do you keep your palate from getting overloaded from tasting so many wiskies on a sitting?

to me the finish is so important in judging the taste of a whisky.  do you feel this inhibits your juding buy spitting the whisky out?  or do you take small sips of each whisky so that you can experience the finish?

you really should do an ama on here.
