**alberta premium dark horse, 45% abv**

sample courtesy of studiorat.

* nose: sharp spicy cereal and conifer notes. vanilla and cinnamon. a bit of dark chocolate.  burnt brown sugar and juicy sultanas. potpourri, grass and mint. faint solvent notes.

* taste: light-medium bodied and zesty. turkish delight. sweet and floral. maple syrup. fresh mint and basil. marmalade. toasted dry oak.

* finish: ripe citrus. white pepper, oak spice and char. eucalyptus cough drops. lavender and dried herbs. burnt plastic (very slight). medium and bittersweet.

the best canadian whisky i've had... actually one of the better world whiskies i've had. very floral but i'm okay with that. nice robust flavours with a reasonable amount of complexity. there were some off notes in the nose and finish but i didn't mind.

i apologise to all you canadians for shitting on your whiskies in the past. turns out you guys *can* make good whisky.
