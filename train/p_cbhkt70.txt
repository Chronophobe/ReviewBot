still waters is a very young microdistillery based out of concord, ontario (just a couple kilometers outside of toronto, if you’re curious). their proprietors—the two barrys, bernstein and stein—seem to be committed to doing things right, in very small batches. but while their own spirit (rye and single malt) is aging, they’re doing their best to pay the bills in the short-term with a vodka and with this stuff, 1+11 special blend canadian whisky. credit is due to the two barrys for openly acknowledging on the bottle that this stuff is sourced (though not from where), and (though this part isn’t on the bottle) then finished with the addition of a small amount of rye from still waters own stock.

why the name? well, i’ve heard two theories: one is that it took twelve tries to get the blend right. the other, somewhat conspiratorially notes that 1 divided by 11 equals .0909, and that 1/11th (9.09%) is the quantity of “additive” allowable in canadian whisky by law. in this case, as the theory goes, the “additive” here is still waters’ own young rye spirit, which would have been less than three years old when 1+11 was first introduced (though davin at www.canadianwhisky.org points out that the 1/11th law is somewhat misunderstood in the sense that the rye “whisky” additive in this case would still at least have to be two years old).

but anyway, the whisky. . . .

**still waters 1+11 special blend canadian whisky**; no age statement; bottled in 2012; batch no. 1206, one of 1440 bottles; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $39 cdn. in the province of alberta (if you can find it), though it’s a much more reasonable $29 cdn. in its home province of ontario.

**appearance:** old gold or amber. the legs actually aren’t bad for a young, low-abv whisky. the bottle and branding are functional (i actually kind of like them), which is appropriate for such a small-scale operation.

**nose:** light, but nice. some youthful zing. butterscotch, vanilla. and then a young, spicy rye. bready. pine. light oak. citrus. licorice? light caramel. light clove. grass or hay. green apples. crab apples? light floral. corn. the young rye, as far back as it is in the mix, is the most interesting part here. 

**taste:** a bit thin, and yet there’s still a decent oiliness on the tongue that i like (no chill filtering, i assume). very light, but again quite pleasant. diluted vanilla extract; very light toffee or butterscotch. green apples. olive oil. soft oak. faintly herbal (pine, again?), some citrus (orange peel?), and then a nice bit of tingling rye spice. faintly gin-like even, maybe? rye bread. green leaf vegetables? again, quite light, but actually more interesting than it seems on first glance. not overly sweet.

**finish:** there and gone, with just a hint of rye tingling on the tongue. clove. faint, faint green apple and light toasted oak.

**final thoughts:** so light as to almost constitute an ontological crisis, but not a bad whisky by any stretch of the imagination. smooth. it tones down the typical canadian whisky sweetness quite a bit, which is good. i can’t see it mixing all that well because it’s so mild (any mixer i can think of would just *erase* it), but it drinks surprisingly well neat (especially now, in the summer). ultimately a bit hard to score: i like what still waters is doing, and i want to support them (and have already picked up a bottle of stalk &amp; barrel, which i hope to review shortly). but while i acknowledge this is a very well-made whisky, it’s a bit too light for my tastes. then again, it’s probably not my tastes this is targeting in the first place, and at any rate it’s still much better than cc/crown/gibson’s/black velvet/canadian mist/etc.,.

**score:** 81
