named for a suburb in my hometown, it was pretty much automatic that i was going to have to try this stuff. after sampling lot no. 40, its premium canadian whisky sibling, it became imperative that i try it.

pike creek is the second in a set of whiskies that corby distillers (best known for the wiser’s brand) released in the 90s, only to discontinue them. but though they never sold well in their first iteration, they built a cult following, and they’re back (no word on whether the third, gooderham and worts, will be making a similar return).

with lot no. 40, it’s easy to see why that cult following began. pike creek doesn’t quite live up to its sibling—by my taste, at least—but it’s a very likeable, well-priced canadian whisky nonetheless. and one, moreover, that i strongly suspect would appeal to a single malt aficionado (especially a fan of sherried or port-finished malts) for its rich, wonderfully fruity flavour profile. pike creek basically screams that there’s more to canadian whisky than vanilla, oak, and rye flavours.

pike creek; 10 years old; double-matured, first in oak and then finished in port barrels; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for $39 in this part of canada—the same price as lot no. 40

**appearance:** the bottle—with its mixture of glass-etching and paper label, the wood cork and the little twig ‘nest’ that sits around the neck—is lovely. the whisky inside is, i suspect, caramel-coloured, but there is nevertheless just a tinge of reddishness there to convince me that the port finish has had an effect. not much in the way of legs.

**nose:** enormously likeable. there’s a bit of youth still here (some alcohol prickle at first), but the nose is quite evocative and reminds me of an interesting cross between a more typical canadian whisky profile and a sherry- or port-finished single malt scotch. vanilla, oak, a bit of rye spiciness and breadiness, holiday spice—but also dark fruits (raisins, figs) and nuttiness. strawberries, perhaps. vinous. brown sugar. a drop of water sweetens her up a bit, but it’s not a tremendous difference.

**taste:**  soft mouthfeel; citrus, spicy rye, oak, vanilla. but still fruity—again, raisins, but perhaps berries as well. brown sugar. a drop of water kicks up the citrus a bit for me, but this guy works well without any addition.

**finish:** not bad; medium-length—warm and dry, with citrus, oak, vanilla, some fruitiness, brown sugar and raisins.

**final thoughts:** pike creek has the unfortunate position of being stacked up against its sibling, maybe the best canadian whisky i’ve tried. in that battle, pike creek loses—it lacks the spicy rye boldness of lot no. 40. that said, there’s a family resemblance, and i can easily see how someone would prefer pike creek to that lot 40, especially if that someone happens to be a big scotch drinker. this is a lovely, lovely bottle, well-worth trying, and i find myself liking it more with every sip i take.

**score:** 88
