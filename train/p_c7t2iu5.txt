end of the year review #4: amrut single malt â€“ cask strength

my final year-end review is for a whisky coming from india. amrut has been around since the 1940's but just spread to europe in the 1990's and launched in america in 2010. i have liked everything i have had from them, fusion being absolutely wonderful, but i will be reviewing the cask strength. amrut has no age statement, and it is a bit of a mystery, but the general consensus is they figured out a way to put this out in under 4 years. 

this is the second consecutive heavyweight i am reviewing, coming in at 61.8% abv. this really helps accentuate the big bright flavors found in this dram. the nose is rich with honey and malt and slight traces of vanilla and grassy pasture. the palate is dominated by malted barley, a strait forward example of what a malt whisky is without sherry, peat, or other influence. there is a slight tingle of ethanol (coming from the high proof) and subtle spice, and a very pleasing warmth. long finish, slightly sweet, and ever present malt.

much like the four roses small batch, this doesn't get many points for complexity, but makes up for it in richness. despite the short aging, amrut delivers like any 10-12 year scotch would and could hold it's own in a side by side with any of scotland's best offerings. **91/100**

a quick side note, i have always drank whiskey neat, with no water added. it's been a while doing it just that way so i have been trying a splash of water again here and there. water turned this dram into and over-oaked mess, would not recommend.
