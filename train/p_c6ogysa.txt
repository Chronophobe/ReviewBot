woooo! my first review on the new sub :-)

i don't think that i've reviewed a true irish whisky yet (they normally spell it as "whiskey")! that's a real shame, since irish stuff is making a real comeback lately with several popular and well-reviewed bottlings. i'll try to get to those at some point (ie i need to buy them first!), but in the meantime, let's begin with a review of a supremely available and popular irish whisky: bushmills original!

bushmills is a blended irish whisky, meaning that it consists of a mix of malt and grain whisky. a blended scotch whisky is the same. the difference is that most scotch whisky is usually distilled twice, whereas most irish whisky is distilled three times. triple distillation usually produces a lighter spirit, which is a trait commonly associated with irish whisky as a style. triple-distilled scotch whiskies, like those from auchentoshan distillery, usually share this reputation. let's see how bushmills stacks up!

**bushmills original**

**color:** amber -2 (ooh, hopefully no caramel! i always appreciate an honest presentation.)

**abv:** 40%

**aroma neat:**

lemon drops, golden delicious apples, tinned pears, hay, blended honey (light), vanilla (lots), mixed grains (hot cereal), wheat toast.

starts with light fruit and honeyed/vanilla sweetness, then grainy notes emerge (the nice kind). it's a very soft nose, which comes across as very clean and refreshing. complex, no, but not certainly welcoming. i'm reminded a bit of the major's reserve from glen grant. 

**aroma water:**

confectioner's sugar, lemon juice, lime, mixed grains, vanilla frosting.

similar to neat, but it's disappearing!!! naturally, as a young whisky at 40%, it doesn't take water terribly well. i didn't drown it, i wouldn't recommend adding more than 2 or so drops to a standard dram! it's just not needed.

**taste neat:**

hay, raw grains, lemon, light apple juice, vanilla, honey, wax.

grainy and light, as expected. light fruitiness is present, likely from the distillate. plenty of vanilla, as with the nose. i think the vast majority of the barrels going into this blend were refill bourbon. lot's of sweet american oak character, but not enough to overpower the light spirit. by the way, the spirit itself is better than expected. this is a nas blend, but there's no outputtingly harsh or off notes, as can occasionally be the case with young whisky. 
** 
taste water:**

grain, wax, earthy/soil, cookies (sugar and oatmeal), oak (sourish).  

the first "unclean" earthy note pops out. causes perhaps by some slight sulfur is a sherry cask? not really sure, it could easily be from the distillate. i haven't had enough bushmills to really develop a familiarity, though. the nose seemed ok after a few drops, but the palate has really drown and turned a bit unpleasant. 

**finish:**

vanilla, wax, oak, low tannins, barrel char, chocolate (slight), grain.

doesn't stick around too long, but that's to be expected. waxy vanilla lingers longest, but i wish it was a little more drying. 

**conclusion:**

clean, enticing nose.

refreshing palate neat, but muddied and drown with water.

short, sweetish, but acceptable finish when neat. with water it takes on the same unpleasant characteristics as the palate.
 
**rating:** 76/100

clean, refreshing, and agreeable. bushmills is a nice whisky overall. it's not something you'll sit and sip for an hour, but it was never meant to be. it's a light, accessible dram to have with friends. did i mention it's really inexpensive as well? drink it neat - no muss, no fuss. the palate's just too disappointing with water.
