this is my first solo review, 1st was the laddie 10 community review.
i am studying in japan right now, so as my choices are vast (a few shops near me have what i would get to be 1000 different bottles..), my money is quite limited. this 500ml bottle was 1480jpy. this is my final dram... (excuse the glass..)

i was stuck between this miyagikyo and the yoichi as they seem to always be priced and placed next to each other. i went for this due to the darker color hoping for more age on it or at least a bit more oak flavor. note, there is no age statement, and i do not believe there to be any e150 etc...

**color**: amber/ golden, perhaps a light honey sheen.

**nose**: toffee, brown sugar, hint of banana, and a touch of nail polish remover....

**taste**: rather smooth, at first a bit buttery but quickly thinning out. honestly, not too much going on here. a bit harsh..

**finish**: i want to stay i taste some peat, it could just be from a charred cask, a bit lesser of a level than the laddie 10. i get hints of seaweed as well. i think this is just in my head as i don't have a clue where it would come from. this whiskey does linger a decent amount of time, with a bit of a sharp edge(i believe due to being young).

**overall**: reminds me of what ralphy was talking about with japan trying to imitate scotch whiskey. it just isnt quite there. next i think i might move away from japanese, or just splurge on some hibiki... 
price: 4/5 (for being in japan...) i will not be buying this again.

final score..: 75/100
