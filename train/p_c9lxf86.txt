i'll admit i don't know a ton about bully boy distillers... but they're a hometown small distiller and i thought i might drop a few bucks ($38) to see what they're about. 

the whiskey is bottled at 42%, non chill filtered, and aged in american oak. it claims to be made from a combination of corn, rye, and malted barley but gives no sense of the proportions. no age statement, but it's a "straight whiskey" so it's 2+ years.

- **nose:** caramel sweetness, rye spice, vanilla, oak. lighter and not as sweet as a bourbon would be. 
- **palate:** light on the palate, but not unpleasant. a little bit of sweetness and a lot of oak. lots of youthful alcohol burn as well, i bet this is pretty close to the minimum 2 year age. 
- **finish:** a little oak, a little rye, and then it's gone.

so, it's a young spirit from a small distiller and it tastes that way. but! the spirit is obviously of a high quality, well balanced and with some natural depth to it. a few more years on oak and this could really be something.

so would i buy this again? probably not, but it's an easy drinking whisky with some character and i'd love to see what they can do with 5-10 years to age this stuff. a worthy buy to promote an obviously quality local distillery.
