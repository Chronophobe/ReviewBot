hola ww, texacer here with another quick review.  i've had a bottle of **canadian club classic 12 year old 80 proof** in my possession for almost two years and it wont go away.


* color: greasy amber
* nose: pancakes.  butter.  maple syrup.  pepsi. ivory soap. acrylic paint. 
* taste: maple syrup pancakes.  sweet vanilla creme.  melted butter and sugar. gasoline.
* finish: sickly


borders on a liquer.  it's like eating a stack of pancakes and syrup.  this is making canada look like a stereotype.  someone (rusty) come over and finish my bottle for me.
