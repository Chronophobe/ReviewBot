i grew up on the standard bottling of crown royal (and the standard bottling of cc), but the more experience i have with it, the less palatable i find it. but having only tried the entry-level expression, i wondered whether my growing aversion was of that bottle, or of the brand’s signature style as a whole.  after all, crown royal is known for its smoothness and bourbon-like characteristics—and since bourbon doesn’t rank incredibly high on my list of favourite whisky styles, and since i prefer flavour to smoothness—two things i don’t necessarily look for in my canadian whiskies.

but still, anything for science. crown royal limited edition is—after the standard and the black—the next level up the brand’s food chain (retailing around $36 cdn. locally), although i’ve been informed le isn’t currently available outside of canada. how unfortunate.

crown royal limited edition canadian whisky; no age statement; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $36 cdn.

**appearance:** on the light side of amber-ish. i would guess caramel-colouring all the way; not much in the way of coating the glass, though credit where credit is due—the decanter-style bottle is pretty elegant and wicked (though one wishes they would have sprung for the cork over the screw-top lid).

**nose:** rather closed at first, but this is definitely a crown royal expression. tiny bit of a whisky prickle, some dusty rye, but a lot of bourbon-like qualities—oak and vanilla at the fore. some sweet rye, cloves, faintly floral. peppermint? distant fruit (apples?). an improvement on the standard bottling, and respectable, but nothing here really shines. a drop of water plays up the apples (maybe some peaches?) and the vanilla oak a bit and maybe brings out a hint of maple or toffee, but mutes some of the other flavours.

**taste:** smooth. sweet, citrus (orange peels), oak, vanilla, burnt sugars.  white pepper. some sweet and then dry rye. nice, but not world-changing in any way. a drop of water brings just an instantaneous bit of fruit (fresh peaches), but it fades quickly.

**finish:** medium-short. citrus, some vanilla-oak, some nice fruit drifts in and out (peaches?—no, not a question mark, *definitely* peaches).

**final thoughts:** a respectable sipping whisky (one wonders whether this isn’t closer to crown royal as it existed in its early years), but lacks the complexity and the wow-factor that i’ve been finding in a lot of canadian whiskies recently.  a noticeable improvement on the standard crown royal bottling (which i can’t stomach in anything but mixed drinks or loaded over ice these days), but one that fits in a nebulous kind of price range that suggests there are better purchases—within $5 in either direction there are absolutely stellar canadian whiskies that make purchasing crown royal limited edition difficult to justify. don't get me wrong, it's good, and i can imagine a time when this would have been considered a great canadian whisky, but there are so many interesting, innovative and bold things being done in canadian whisky right now that crown royal le just seems to pale in comparison.

**final score:** 81

[*n.b.* incidentally, the 'limited edition' label here is a bit of a misnomer, since this stuff has been on the shelves for several years now, and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.]
