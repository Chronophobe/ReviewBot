**redbreast 15, 46% abv**

*single pot still irish whiskey*

* nose: gingerbread, toffee and cocoa. cereal, cinnamon and pepper. glace cherries, honey roasted nuts and oak spice. a bit grassy and minty. faint metallic notes. leather, vanilla and musk.

* taste: medium-full bodied, creamy and mouth-coating. milk chocolate, barley sugar and sweet cereal followed by sharp citrus and spices. honey eucalyptus cough drops. salted caramel. rosehip tea with honey. dried mandarin peel, ripe kiwi and salted kumquats. 

* finish: ripe citrus, anise and nutmeg. double macchiato with brown sugar. herbal and a bit piney. medium, peppery and tannic.

the best irish i've had. well balanced and quite complex. i still got some pine and mint/menthol notes that i normally get in irish whiskeys, but they work here and were not overwhelming. 

i need to find some cs redbreast...

&gt;**88/100**

big ups to ayedfy, gooshwa and the18thelement for splitting this bottle with me. i probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise.
