to be fair, people can't just order this stuff. once an allotment is filled, there's no more. that makes it limited. the number of bottles doesn't really matter, imo. are they playing it up? sure, but i don't care. there are endless special releases in whiskey and they're all limited and no one throws a fuss. if anything they complain about how few bottles there are, not how many.
