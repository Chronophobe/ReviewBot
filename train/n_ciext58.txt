i didn't compare whistle pig. it's been a while since i've been in that bottle, but my memory is it's a different animal. i try to compare similar bottles as much as possible. i guess i need to open it back up. ae rye too is different with the finish. i haven't got that one yet though.

when i get to reviewing those two bottles, maybe i'll swing back to this one.

it's a really nice rye, but i'd probably only buy it again because it's rare. i think i'd be happy with ceht rye if both were equally available.
