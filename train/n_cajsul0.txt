i posted this to /r/scotch but it i think it got removed (for reasons i undertstand). anyway:

haven't opened them yet but tonight i'll be enjoying.

specfically the iw harper though i just realized that it probably shouldn't be here but in /r/whiskey. however if you aren't familiar with that brand - iw is produced in kentucky and nowhere else. years ago a group of japanese bought exclusive rights to the product and you can't presently get it anywhere except japan. i thought it would be interesting to share.

the other two speak for themselves.

japan is a true whisky haven - we visited a few different whiskey bars and they were all amazing, from the hosts to the recommendations to the music (japanese love jazz, the atmosphere in the whisky bars there is wonderful).

prices in duty free:

hibiki: 6500 yen: ~$69

yamazaki: 4500 yen: ~$48

iw: 3500 yen: ~$37
