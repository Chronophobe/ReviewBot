good evening, world whisky! i figured i should do a proper review of a whisky after our recent ama from lsd!

**lost spirits’ leviathan i cask #4 53% abv**

* color: deep copper
* nose: wow. this is unlike any other single malt i’ve ever had. candied plums, oversweet jam, earthy, dry cabernet, thick moss, vegetal, and sea salt.
* taste: dry. such a strange whisky. it’s like overly bitter wine, dried plums (sweetness reminds me of a lara bar), and vegetal moss. not much smoke like i would have expected. the earthiness is on a completely different level than just your average peat bomb. it’s like raw veggies and sea salt. this is certainly a distilled enigma in a glass.
* finish: medium in length, no burn whatsoever. still big vegetal moss with dry cabernet and dried/candied plums. the vegetal sweetness remains.
* overall: i did some reading around and knew that i was getting into a very strange whisky with this one. i read countless accounts of how you need to approach this assuming it’s unlike any other single malt you will have ever tried. however, i feel i was still unprepared. this is an absolute curveball of a single malt.  the flavors are entirely of their own. there is wine, but not your average sherry/port. there’s peat, but not smoke or iodine. there’s sweetness, but not your average red fruits or apples. it’s strange, but i oddly like it. bryan is churning out some interesting stuff in cali.

**82/100**
