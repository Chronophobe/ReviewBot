hey guys, this is my 1st world whiskey review. i decided to go with the jameson tonight. i was able to find a 50ml sample bottle weeks ago for $2. i have a 40 creek on the way. i hope i end up liking that.

review #1: jameson

abv: 40%

color: amber

nose: woody, alcohol burn, coconuts, vanilla, candy, cream

taste: vanilla, cream, honey, nuts, coconut, lickerish, candy, cinnamon

finish: quick dash of cinnamon, honey, nuts. smooth

conclusion: oh wow. i think this whiskey is quite underrated and unappreciated. i didn't think i'd find it this lovely. i found it surprisingly good. i actually like this over johnnie walker black label right now. i will look forward to having the other jameson offerings.

score: 84/100
