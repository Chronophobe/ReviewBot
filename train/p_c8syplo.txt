**bushmills 10, single malt irish whiskey, 40% abv, 50ml sample**

* nose: tart and bitter grapefruit. blood oranges. grains, cereal and honey. pine cones and eucalyptus oil. white pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg.

* taste: light and thin. menthol, pine and eucalyptus. grainy and ashy. cornflakes. white pepper and anise.

* finish: rubbing alcohol. dry herbs, menthol and bitter cigarette tar. pine-o-cleen disinfectant. medium, dryish and warming.

i don't know why, but i get a lot of pine and mint/menthol in irish whiskeys. it's not unpleasant, but i'm not sure it's my thing. 

very similar to the clontarf 10. same score.
