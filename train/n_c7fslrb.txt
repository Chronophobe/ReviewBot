tried to give a little international flair with it.

a nice entry level sherry, i give this out a lot to guests to introduce them to scotch.  

a jamo you can only get at the distillery in dublin, the bottle is special, not so much what is inside.

ec12, solid as a rock.  you would be hard pressed to find a better value in bourbon.
