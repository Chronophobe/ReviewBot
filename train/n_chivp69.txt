just thought this bottle i got from the lcbo today was very mildly interesting. 

itâ€™s labelled as 2003 vintage, even though it was barrelled well into 2004. it was bottled this year, after the 2004 vintage seems to have already been released. 

also, the front label is entirely english, but the rear label is almost entirely french - maybe it was supposed to have gone to quebec or something.

can anyone shed any light on if the different vintages are selected for different taste profiles, or whether this was just a case of using old labels?
