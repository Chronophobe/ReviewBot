bourbonski here with a quick comparo. i'm in no mood to give a full review, my apologies but it's baby's bath time and there's chicken on the grill. i'm three pours deep and feeling randy. scratch that, no apologies. 
so i wanted to run dant up against barton and then decided i might as well crack the handle of ew that was just sitting there. staring at me. so here goes:
dant- oaky, spicy
barton- oaky, spicy
ew- oaky, spicy
i guess the point is that they're similar enough that it comes down to personal preference. fwiw the ew was the least offensive and had top mouthfeel. possible because it was the last one but it was thicker and creamier. they are all great values but for some reason i can get evan for $22 a handle, barton is $23 and dant for $28 so it's an easy decision for a mixer and occasional sipper. 
party on wayne.
