###crown royal® deluxe canadian whisky

**exceptional smoothness and taste**

*gold medal 2010 san francisco world spirits*

crown royal®, canada's leading premium canadian whisky, has a tradition as rich and distinctive as its taste. the exquisite blend was painstakingly created from 50 selected whiskies, to commemorate a royal tour in 1939. crown royal's smooth, elegant style is considered the epitome of canadian whisky.

made from milled corn, rye and malted barley, and distilled to the highest standards, these whiskies are aged in both seasoned and new white oak barrels and eventually selected at their optimum maturity to create the crown royal® blend.

with its rich flavour and pleasant bouquet, crown royal®, an exceptional canadian whisky, can be served on the rocks, straight up or in a variety of cocktails.
