low turnout this time with 15 people.  average score was 89 with the highest and lowest score removed, and the range from the same subset was only 11.  third smallest range, but all comparable reviews with that low of a range had 15 reviewers or less.

next month is going to be auchentoshan 3 wood, so get ready.  see you on the 5th for ancnoc 12 (i wanted to do one on a weekend so people who actually work would have a chance to contribute for a change).

if anyone wants me to use their photo for the ancnoc review, i will.  post it here or pm it to me.
