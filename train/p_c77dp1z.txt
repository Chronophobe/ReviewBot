**gibson's 18**  

gibson's is a rather self-contained canadian phenomenon that bottles very dependable - if unexciting - blended canadian whisky for local and northern us consumption. i've never been particularly interested in their very popular 12 year bottling but one day the new "gibson's finest rare 18 years old" appeared on my local shelf for a seemingly-sane price ($60cad, it has since increased) and i thought i'd give the much-maligned aged canadian whisky world another spin.

**nose**  
the nose is rather dominated by a very glenlivet-esque burst of citrus and apple. the mildness of the rye ingredients is completely covered up by the original hit of alcohol and the subsequent sweet aromas. this is a pretty delicate nose, i had to really dig in there (literally!) to get any sort of extra substance. older whiskies often dominate with the usual oak and toffee, but not here. vanilla helps the gibson's 18 become a really easy whisky for nosing. a very pleasant bottle with not much challenge or surprise.

**palate**  
finally, the rye that i had heard about appears on the palate. thanks to the extra aging - and i assume extra blending - this is a very gentle and long-lasting rye experience. the floral/citrus notes from the nose appear to have completely abandoned the palate. there's spice and heat from the rye, but it's so gentle and long-lasting that i could easily mistake it for sweetness and candy-like flavour. really quite nice, if you wait  long enough for it to arrive.

**finish**  
long lasting and spicy, but not in the uncomfortable or powerful way you get from a young alberta premium or even the younger gibson's blends. the finish is where the aging really makes its mark since its effects have been rather hidden up until now.

considering the subtle nature of the rest of this dram, the finish's remarkably long nature is really the best part of this whisky. it's one thing that stands out. 

**conclusion**

very pleasant and gentle with a bit of rye power behind it, but not very compelling. i'd be hard-pressed to pick this bottle out of a taste test, even with 18 years behind it.

with wm grant and sons acquisition of gibson's, i don't know what to think about the future potential of this distillery to engage in some more risk taking. perhaps some deviation from the 40% alcohol rule would make gibson's whiskies much more compelling.

you might want to avoid water or ice with this whisky. this bottle seems like a surprisingly good christmas present since it seems both aged and distinctive, but is still very approachable by any sort of drinker.

try and save the empty glass by putting some sort of lid over it overnight. the smell of the oak left in the glass is really quite wonderful.
