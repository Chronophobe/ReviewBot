yerrbo was kind enough to gift me this dram as part of [our recent swap](http://www.reddit.com/r/scotchswap/comments/1ehido/whisky_whiskey_and_unidentifiable_brown_drank/), but didn't bother telling me what kind of liquor it was. here's hoping i don't make a fool of myself.

* **color:** full gold, reddish hue. could easily be bourbon from the color.

* **nose:** nope, pretty sure this is barley malt. very fragrant; floral. fruity/sherry/winey is dominant but i'm getting some vanilla underneath.

* **taste:**  dried fruit and toffee with citrus notes. honey, oak, pepper.

* **finish:** nutty and woody. lingering subtle nutmeg/cinnamon spice.

i'm going to guess a sherried single malt scotch in the 46% abv area. reminded me somewhat of balvenie doublewood, but with stronger spicier flavor and a better finish. **85/100**
