a lot of people out there know canadian whiskies for either canadian club, crown royal, or whatever the heck canadian mist is (seriously, wtf is it?). maybe alberta premium.

the sad part is that, liter for litre, **wiser's deluxe** is a better mixing canadian whisky than the typical standard fares of the ones above (maybe not alberta premium). it tastes better, it's less harsh, and i've had less hangovers or whisky rage while drinking it.

so when i saw a little left in a bottle this weekend, i thought i'd share it with everyone else. i know most of you reading this probably know about it, however i think more people should too.

**region:** the democratic people's republic of canuckastan

**abv:** 40%

**price:** $26.95 (cad)

**colour:** fool's gold

**nose:** maple, banana, ferns, coconut, cream, bread

there's a fairly decent mix of sweetness, herbs, and yeast on the nose here. this may hurt.

**taste:** bread pudding, caramel, vanilla, passion fruit, blueberries, wheat germ, burn, smooth

very light taste on this one. i can see now, tasting it neat, why i used to mix it. it wouldn't screw around with the coke flavour. if i'm to judge it on it's own, there's not much going on, and i really have to hunt for the flavours, which are quite weak.

**finish:** carrot cake, cotton, o.j., paper, oats, pepper, mint, cashew, almonds

more sweetness, and now with cotton! haven't you always wanted to chew on your own shirt? seriously though, not as bad as some others. it's bland, yeah, but it could be worse.

**conclusion:** so, should you run out and buy a bottle to try it? no! this is a mixing whisky! that being said, wiser's is some nice stuff, and for a bargain bin canuck, this wasn't that horrible. i'm assuming it's oxidized a little, though it didn't taste like a puck to the face. so i guess if you have a chance, try it. you won't be surprised it's sweet, however you'll be surprised that you don't want to punch someone in the face.

**73/100**
