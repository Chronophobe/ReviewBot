i have not! but 2 days after my 21st, we had a nice dinner, and my moms boyfriend ordered (he still won't tell me) either a 21 or a 25... he wants me to figure it out on my own, if i truly have a taste for it. but i definitely enjoy'd what i had. a pretty decent balance between smokey, smooth, and tha after burn &lt;3. i've been pretty hooked on black label for the past year or two, so i'm accustomed to the more smokey brands, i know that much.
