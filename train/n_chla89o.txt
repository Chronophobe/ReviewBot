yes, i know the preakness happened yesterday.  this is a novelty i picked up last year before the derby and haven't either seen since locally, or seen discussed much around here on /r/bourbon.  

it seems to be maker's mark thinned out with white creme de menthe. the mint in this particular bottle is a little forward, but settles out nicely over ice. nothing spectacular, but quite flavorful.  i've enjoyed it every session i've poured it, and i'm happy to share the last pour with all of you.

cheers!  looking forward to the belmont.
