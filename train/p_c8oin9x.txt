i can't believe it took me this long to get around to reviewing jameson! with st patrick's day coming up, i figure this is a good a time as any. is any explanation necessary? i think everyone knows what jameson is or has at least tried it. well, just to be safe, jameson is a no-age statement, blended irish whisky that's wildly popular. in fact, i think for a long time people associated irish whisky with jameson exclusively. luckily, there are more and more excellent irish whiskies becoming available to a global audience. i'd recommend checking out some of these alternatives as you prepare for st patrick's day, especially the pure pot still ones!

**jameson**

**color:** amber +0 (caramel...)

**abv:** 40%

aroma neat:
flint, steel, raw barley, sweet wort/oily grains, watery honey, paper pulp/mushy oak, vanilla extract, bananas, coconut, plasticine, nutmeg, sooty coal/smoke (very slightly), homemade marshmallows, stewed apples, nutmeg.

more characterful overall that one might expect for such a standard product. there is a nice metallic note, in addition to fruit and grain. the only negative aspect is a general sense of artificiality. it's not overwhelming, but distracting. overall much, much better than i remembered!

**aroma water:**

raw barley, malt grist, flint, steel/metallic, waxy oak, brown sugar/fresh caramel, french vanilla, dry grass, dried shredded coconut, cinnamon, marzipan, cornmeal, cardboard, cola flavored marshmallows, diced apples.

still a very nice nose. the artificial note i was detecting before seems to have gone away.

**taste neat:**

oak, roasty honey, waxy malt/grain, buttery nuttiness, syrupy brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, flint/minerality, yeast (slightly).

mmm, another pleasant surprise. i must have been in a bad mood the last time i had jameson (probably more than a year ago), because i actually think it's a pretty decent blend. maybe i'm just more attuned to irish whisky now. then again, perhaps midleton distillery has improved the quality of jameson by including more of the excellent pot still whisky used for redbreast and yellow spot...

**taste water:**

honey, dry oak, rounded tannins, fresh vanilla, hazelnuts/cola, brown sugar, steel/copper, toasted malt/cooked grains.

**finish:**

malt barley (slightly bitter), cardboardy oak, soda bread, mineral, hazelnuts, cinnamon/honey.

not very long lasting, but tasty. the slight cardboard flavor isn't a detriment, though it sometimes can be.

**conclusion:**

complex nose with a lot of dimension.

balanced palate with plenty of character. honey, oak, and spice, oh my!

short, but otherwise good quality finish.

**rating:** 83/100

quite frankly, jameson has really impressed me. it puts many scottish blends in the same price bracket to shame. the integration of malt (well, pot still) and grain whisky is much more harmonious than in comparably priced scottish blends like j&amp;b. i also much prefer this to the standard bushmills, which is perhaps a little too clean and simple. this is right on par with the very good green spot, which has a bit of a sweeter profile.
