hello everyone. i had a little bit from this sample bottle and decided to do a review before the rest of it oxidised too much in the bottle.

**info:**  this whisky gets its name as it is a “fusion” of barley grown in the himalayas and peated barley imported from scotland. 

* **colour:** is dark straw with multiple thick tears forming quickly.

* **nose:** a lovely sherry and peat combination as the two different barleys fight for dominance. growing sweetness as the sherry pulls ahead. 

* **taste:**the sherry comes out in front here again. it’s similar to a young speyside like singleton or ‘farclas 12. nice subtle fruity flavours with a bit of spice. all the while that smoke and peat is still there coming in waves but i’m not quite sure if it’s complimenting or fighting against the sherry. after a while in the glass the smoke becomes stronger and i also get a bit of a caramel touch with the spice intensifying. after a little while in the glass this whiskey works itself out nicely. 

* **finish:**the sherry accepts its defeat here and the peat finally comes through as a peaty smokiness building almost to an islay level. bit of a light burn. 


* **thoughts:** the amrut website they say that there are no sherry casks used in the creation of this whiskey despite its sherry notes which they confirm in their own review. i do love how this whiskey is fighting against itself the entire time going from sherry to peat and ending up with a great balance of the two. 

**85/100**
