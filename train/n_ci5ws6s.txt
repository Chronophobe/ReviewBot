thank you for your information.  i really believe that they both serve a purpose, however i'm really enjoying trying a few different ones out of the new glass and am really enjoying the more "mellow" feel of whiskey out of it.  less alcohol burn and more pronounced flavors (in certain respects).

as far as breaking, when they are drying and fall over (hit accidentally or something).  they tend to shatter into thousands of pieces making cleanup tough.  they are heavily weighted toward the bottom so it doesn't take much for them to tip.
