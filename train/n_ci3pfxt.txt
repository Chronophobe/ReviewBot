i'd always been pretty happy with my very spendy riedel glasses, but i figured i'd better discover what all the glencairn fuss was about. here are my thoughts, using the tasty auchentoshan three wood as a control. notes were taken only on the nose, of course.

from the riedel tulip-shaped single-malt glass: caramel, cherry, briny ocean air, random fruit, lots of copper penny (leading me to wonder if the half bottle left had started to oxidize after being open a month or two). grassy top notes.

from the glencairn: cinnamon oatmeal with brown sugar, fresh nutmeg, fresh sea air. some caramel, but it's more of a side-note than as present in the riedel glass. a little alcoholic heat, but not even a whisper of the oxidized copper scent. heathery top notes. every once in a while some unpleasant paint fumes. faint hint of caffe mocha.

overall, it was completely obvious to me that the glencairn was just showing a lot more of everything. it seemed like looking at the whiskey through a microscope. everything was magnified, for good and for bad. i don't think i'll be going back to the riedel, no matter how gosh darn pretty they are!
