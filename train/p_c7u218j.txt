hello ww, texacer here with another quick review from canaduh, eh.  this time its another 40creek... **forty creek port wood reserve 90 proof**, you know i've had the standard release in miniature form before and it really did nothing for me like most of these whiskies from up nort.  but:


* color:  deep oily orange
* nose: fruity, salty.  berries.  dry, paper.  floral, like petunias. sourness. potato skin
* taste:  raisins and molasses.  honey vanilla, savory.  thick.  salted port wine. malty potatoes with lawrys. .  
* finish: develops slowly. 

reminds me of highland park with a port finish.  nose doesnt do the taste justice.  good complexity.  potato is really interesting...  another "good" canadian whisky of the 10 samples i received from a good samaritan here.  

&gt;88/100
