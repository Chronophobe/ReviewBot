yellow spot has recently been reintroduced as a 12 year old whisky. it's garnered a lot of praise since its release, even winning whisky advocate's irish whisky of the year award. i liked it nas brother green spot, but redbreast 12, another single pot still whisky from midleton distillery, was a real favorite. i think yellow spot has a good chance to follow in those footsteps, especially considering that is presented at 46% abv and is non chill filtered. good stuff!

**yellow spot**

**color:** amber +1

**abv:** 46%

**aroma neat:**

french vanilla, honey, caramel, toffee, raw barley, cocoa powder/grist, cinnamon, dark brown sugar, fresh bread (touch of yeast), baked apples, creme brulee, nectarine (slightly), mashed bananas, european oak (slightly spicy), sweet nuttiness/almond paste. 

bourbon, sherry, and malaga casks were used to mature this whisky, and each seems to have something to say. good wood management has led to a complex and delicious smelling whisky. malaga is is not something i've seen much of either.

**aroma water:**

rich buttery oak, dark brown sugar, molasses/rum (slightly), wood oil/polish, vanilla extract, thick custard, apricots/pits, hard water (mineral), fresh-made caramel, bananas foster (slightly), cooked grains

darker and sweeter than neat. i didn't think the nose could get much better, but it's stellar now. a certain oiliness is my favorite bit. the freshness of the bourbon casks supports the rest, much like how grain whisky supports and compliments the malt in a good blend.  

**taste neat:**

apple reduction, cinnamon, nutmeg, almond paste, buttery oak, malty barley, woody vanilla, banana, toasted wood/light char, slate/mineral.

 plenty of interesting wood influence going on, but not a wood-dominant whisky. just a great example of what it can add.

**taste water:**

apple reduction, buttery oak, gentle tannins, toffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, apricot jam, sugar plums, light brown sugar/cane juice, raw vanilla.

quite similar to neat, though a bit fruitier. still delicious!

**finish:**

vanilla, metallic(copper)/mineral tanginess, plummy/stone fruits, apple brandy, woody char, flat ash (slightly), cream (slightly).

the most evidently pot still part of the whisky, with stone fruits and metallic undertones. medium duration.

**conclusion:**

excellent and complex nose which manages to be simultaneously rich and clean. splendid.

balanced palate with pleasing woody sweetness, as a canvas for fruit, spice, and spirit notes.

medium duration finish which is unusually complex.

**rating:** 90/100

yellow spot is a smashingly good whisky, which well deserves the praise it's receiving. i only wish it were easier to obtain in the us. luckily, it's fraternal twin redbreast 12 is very accessible here. comparing the two, redbreast is more spirit forward and i feel it shows off pot still whisky a bit more as a style. yellow spot derives more of its flavor from wood and is sweeter, but still maintains good balance. for me, they are opposite sides of a single delicious coin.
