been a while, /r/worldwhisky, but rest assured i am not letting up on the international drams! i very much enjoy japanese whisky, and in particular the blended malts are made with much care (in contrast to many scottish blended malts...). this particular blended malt is from nikka, who run the two malt distilleries yoichi and miyagikyo. ergo this is a blend of those two distilleries. on to the tasting...


* **nose:** interesting mix of resinous, floral wood and a salty/smoky note in the background. delicate but powerful, if that makes sense! some sherry oak influence giving raisins, dried longan and almonds, but the oak is the real star here. very fragrant.


* **palate:** initially, a short, sweet hit of oloroso sherry fruits, but then the oak tannin and salt dry the palate out. after, more floral notes emerge among the sherry and oak, giving violets, overripe banana, a bit metallic and flinty also. slightly nutty at the tail end, still dry all the way. 


* **finish:** nutty and a hint of chocolate. the oak tannin and salt are but a shadow in the background. spiced sherry oak and incense come to the fore. 


* **overall:** a very complex and interesting whisky, can definitely taste the yoichi salt and the more floral notes of miyagikyo, which come together surprisingly well. the only downside is perhaps a bit too much oak influence taking over. i like the miyagikyo 15 a lot and maybe there's a good reason there is no miyagikyo 20+ release on the market. 

* **score: a** - a very smooth, unique, and complex blended malt. nowhere else can you find something like this!
