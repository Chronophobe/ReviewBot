fairly new to scotch with an unrefined palate. so far my list includes glenlivet, chivas, jw red, famous grouse, the macallen 10 and 12, the glenmorangie lasanta, the balvenie. most of which to me at least seem to be fairly close barring the jw, grouse and chivas. as a veteran one might see how this islay came as quite the surprise. i'm not giving up on it but this may be one that collects a little dust. (at least for now)
