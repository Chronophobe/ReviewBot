hello ww, texacer here with another quick review.  are you even reading this right now?  i hope you are because i try and keep things concise so that you dont have to read a book when reading a review.  another canadian and lo and behold not 80 proof:  **wiserâ€™s small batch canadian 86.8 proof**


* color: tanber
* nose: mild smoke.  grassy greens.  hair. paper.  
* taste: sandy sweet. butter.  vanilla.  thinner.  hairspray. watery spoilt sugar.
* finish: sour

its different. tastes like medicine. tanber is a new word i like.  i had such hopes that abv would help this guy out.  ralfy actually really liked this one.  not me.
