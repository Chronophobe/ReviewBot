hello ww, texacer here with another quick canadian review.  the hockey lovers haven't faired too well in my last bunch of canadian reviews... but.... i did keep the best 3 for last.  up first: **forty creek confederation oak 80 proof**


* color:  tanny
* nose: buttered toast.  oak char.  salty and peppery.  mild feint. 
* taste:  everything i listed in nose plus:  sweet spiced tart fruit.  woody caramelized sugar.  hints of deep fried onion and batter.  good complexity. 
* finish: nice

no maple, yay!  good and actually had complexity.  needs more abv for me to crack the 90s but a step up from my previous canadian encounters.  

&gt;87/100
