of note, i reported cola label #14051001000011 on jefferson's reserve.  this jefferson's reserve is now being bottled by luxco (dba as paramount distilleries) in ohio.  if you are bottled in ohio and have ohio on your label, and your bourbon was not distilled there, then it should say what state it was distilled.
