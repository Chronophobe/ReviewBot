**redbreast 12 cask strength** review #6    
i know that this is not a scotch whisky but is in fact an irish whiskey, however it’s about the only irish whiskey that i would keep in my personal inventory as a staple and worthy of a review. the cask strength version is bottled at a whopping 58.6%, matured for 12 years in oak casks. it is a single pot still whiskey, which means it is made from a mixed mash of malted barley and unmalted barley in a pot still.    
this bottle of rebreast 12 cask strength is b1/12, which i’ve heard from some whiskey connoisseurs is inferior to b1/11, however i could not find this batch anywhere. purchased for $64.99.    
**nose:**  honey, vanilla, oak wood, cloves, allspice.    
**taste:**  very strong - deep honey glaze, spicy, slightly salty and sweet, cloves and wood.    
**finish:**  spicy and tangy at the same time, burnt plastic and buttermilk.    
**in conclusion:**  i wish i had the chance to try b1/11. perhaps the next time i’m feeling like i need a bottle of irish whiskey i’ll search more diligently. this one was ok - it’s certainly strong and gets the buzz going fast, and certainly miles ahead of any irish whiskey i’ve ever tried, but in the end nothing beats out a good single malt.    
**score: 85/100**
