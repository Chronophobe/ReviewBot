and we round out the trek through my father’s liquor cabinet with this, the stuff i grew up on—the stuff i learned to mix into a crown and cola for my parents basically before i could even see over the kitchen countertop (two ice cubes, three fingers of crown, top with cola in a rocks glass). i’m surprised i haven’t gotten around to reviewing this one yet, and i’m surprised there’s really only one review of it in the archive, because it’s basically omnipresent.

**crown royal canadian whisky**; no age statement; 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $28 cdn. in ontario (though i’ve seen it go for as low as $22 cdn. in alberta, because privatized liquor stores want to kill me).

**appearance:** e150a. legs, but pretty runny legs. can’t deny the beauty of the crown royal branding, though, as i’ve said elsewhere.

**nose:** vanilla, toffee, butterscotch some oak and wood char. hard water, or limestone? something sort of ‘rocky’, if that makes sense, like gravel or pebbles. light dusty rye, light baking spice, clove, and cinnamon. no small amount of alcohol prickle. light maple. varnish. faint pepper around the edges. peaches and citrus zest. i’m still trying to make the phrase bourbon-lite™ a thing, but that’s what really strikes me about the cr profile—taking the dominant characteristics of a bourbon and lightening and watering them to make them palatable to a larger audience.

**taste:** a bit watery, but decently creamy. less bite than i remembered, initially, but a growing peppery tingle as it sits in your mouth. light rye spices (more than i recalled, though) with vanilla, light toffee, some varnish notes. citrus pith. warms the whole mouth. faint citrus. a bit of a bitter woodiness that’s not ideal (though at least it pulls back from typical canadian whisky sweetness). but honestly not bad. smooth. the vanilla really grows and asserts itself more over time. it’s not at all perfect, but i could drink this neat or on ice all day long, which is not something i can say about many sub-$30 canadian whiskies.

**finish:** short. some of that bitter wood lingers, but there’s a nice mild heat throughout the mouth, and some lingering rye spice. light vanilla. toasted oak. gravel. light bitter citrus pith.

**final thoughts:** crown royal is the jack daniels of canadian whisky. it’s popular, it’s decent (albeit young, one dimensional, and with some bite), it does its best work in cocktails (seriously? i’ll never in my life turn down a crown and ginger), it’s coasted on reputation, and it gets a lot of hatred from whisky snobs who seem to think they have something to prove. but it’s fine. outright hating it seems to me to be disingenuous, somehow (whereas i think outright hatred of the standard cc seems a lot more justifiable). and even if you do, complaining to the mountaintops about how shit this stuff is isn’t going to change the opinions of the millions of people who love it and sip it religiously. but it is useful to us in at least one way—it demonstrates nicely the process of dumbing down that leads yesterday’s prestige brands to  gradually become today’s mainstream brands (and eventually tomorrow’s discount brands) that are allowed to coast on reputation. there’s almost no collector’s market for canadian whisky, but it’s not surprising that what little market there *is* (just from my cursory glances) seems to orient itself largely around pre-1970s bottlings of crown royal, when the quality of the company’s flagship brand actually seemed to matter something more to them. 

**score:** 73
