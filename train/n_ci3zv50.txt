i generally try not to think too hard about any of phrases that i see as interchangeable - barrel proof, barrel cut, cask strength.

if you wanted to dig deep you can liken their curious use of "whisky" as well. scotch "whisky" mostly uses the term "cask strength" as well, right?

obviously just pulling that relationship out of my ass.
