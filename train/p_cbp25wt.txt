hola ww, texacer here with another quick review.  rusty brought over a bottle of **leviathan ii american peated - lost spirits 106proof** on night while we played some mario kart.  its shitty!

* color: cloudy incandescent red
* nose: plastic cow manure, hot gym socks, foul.  burnt smokey rubber
* taste: burny.  hot pine sap.  sickly barbersol.  sour cardboard
* finish: terribly long

another failed american whisky peated experiment.  they are trying to make an octomore, and its just not good.  ppm110

&gt;30/100
