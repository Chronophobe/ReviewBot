yeah -- at least good things are ahead as more and more people open distilleries. a friend is opening one in denver, but won't have bourbon for years.

have you had the tx whiskey by firestone &amp; robertson? damn tasty. it's a blended mix, so it'll be interesting to see what they come up with on their own.
