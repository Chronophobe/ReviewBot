from the link:

&gt; most of the whiskies in this bottle began their journey 12 years ago. initially, these whiskies were aged in american white oak for 3 years. i then selected the barrels and re-distilled the aged whiskies in my copper pot still to further concentrate their wonderful flavours. this whisky was then re-barreled into french oak casks that had previously held my cabernet sauvignon and aged for an additional 9 years! finally, i introduced some of my favourite personally held barrels to the mix for balancing.

. . . seems . . . over-the-top. but hell, i'd still love to try it.
