there's an abundance of used bourbon barrels as all bourbon must use new casks. depending on the scotch producer they may first fill the ex-bourbon barrel with grain whisky to season the barrel often aging it up to 3 years before actual single malt gets used. also ex-bourbon barrels may be used several times and they become more and more neutral after each use. 

prior to the existence of bourbon, i'm not sure exactly what kind of barrels were used for scotch whisky. it's a good question though.
