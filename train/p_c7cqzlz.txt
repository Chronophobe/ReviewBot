first review, constructive feedback very welcome! apologies for my undeveloped vocabulary.

penderyn madeira welsh whisky, 46% abv, non chill-filtered

**nose** cream toffee, rich fruit and raisins are present as claimed, as well as an oily scent reminiscent of keroscene which gets stronger as you approach to drink

**taste** almost an artificial sweetness, oily, medicinal

**finish** here i get vanilla, raisins and some kind of sweet fruit i cannot place which tastes young and artificial. the final notes are dry and lingers for a medium length of time

**notes** one of the only welsh whiskies, no age statement, aged in bourbon barrels and finished in madeira casks, known as "aur cymru" (welsh gold). definitely unique, noticably young, no peat, no sherry, not woody or floral. was drawn to it as it's close to my home, but wouldn't rush back to it as the bottle can run for over 45 euro.

**score** 72/100
