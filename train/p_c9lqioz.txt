what up ww (i'm hip) texacer here with another quick review.  a mystery dram i got from esajz24:
**trader joes irish single malt 80 proof**

* color: greasy amber
* nose: dirty smoke. pineapple rind.  pine, bourbon.  rocks
* taste: sour.  salty.  vanilla, bananas.  chocolate.  malted milk.  ritz
* finish: buttery, ok

not very good.  strange.  irish just isnt for me.  not the worst irish i've had but meh. 

&gt;76/100
