i went out to a whisky bar a few days ago with some friends, and i’m pretty sure i we ended up at every scotch drinkers wet dream. this place has always been a good whisky bar, having hundreds of bottles available, but since my last visit they have teamed up with the scotch malt whisky society and now offer over a hundred smws bottles. see that book behind the glass? each page is one whisky. apparently the restaurant is one of only 5 in north america that have this partnership. and that’s just the smws stuff, there’s a whole other menu of the usual suspects, hundreds there as well. 

they serve the whisky in a glencairn glass, on a tray with room temperature water and a straw on the side. makes for great experimenting, especially since most of the options are cask strength. 

i settled on the manly dram. i’d never tried a scotch this strong before (over 65%) so i wanted to see what it was like. i didn’t take notes as i was with friends, but it had a nice herbal kind of smoke that was not as overpowering as i expected given the strength. a few drops of water brought out more sweetness. the finish lasted forever and even added a smoky element to the beer i had afterwards. i couldn’t guess a distillery for this, but it doesn’t seem like one that i’ve had before. bruichladdich probably fits that description as i’ve only tried one of their whiskies at a whisky festival last year. 

all this awesome isn’t exactly cheap sadly as my dram came to $20 after taxes, but definitely worth it for a nice treat.

this ends my commercial* for fets whisky kitchen. if you’re ever in vancouver canada, i’d recommend checking it out.
