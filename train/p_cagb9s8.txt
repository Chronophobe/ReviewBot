hey guys! i know this is only available in canada but luckily i have a friend who just came back here. luckily she agreed to bring home a bottle for me. this cost $17 cad at the airport according to her.

review #2: forty creek barrel select

abv: 40%

color: dark amber

nose: alcohol burn, grainy (reminds me of a smell i get from grey goose), vanilla, honey, nuts, oak, syrup

taste: light, sherry, vanilla, grain, oak, honey, walnuts, almonds

finish: a quick wash of spice, sweetness, smooth

conclusion: cheapest bottle i have ever bought. weak nose and weak body but promising. i look forward to having the other expressions.

score: 73
