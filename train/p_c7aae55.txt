this is the very, very well regarded cask strength version of red breast 12 year old. the 40% release was excellent, so how could a cs edition disappoint?

**redbreast 12 cask strength **

**color:** amber +1

**abv:** 57.7%

**aroma neat:**

flint, graphite, raw vanilla bean, spongy wood, cocoa nibs, cloves, ground pepper (slight), coal, varnished wood, custard, dough, hot cereal grains, dark honey, fresh linen, candles, buttered bread, old oak, bronze, apricots.  

certainly similar to the standard 12 year old, but definitely more powerful, with mineral and vanilla notes jumping out immediately. it's a little creamier too. some spices and fruits that were present in the standard 12 seem to be absent here. the wood plays a larger role in this expression so far. alcohol is noticeable, but not unpleasant even at 57.7%.

**aroma water:**

cinnamon, stewed/browned apples, brown sugar, resin, pine, milk caramel squares, dried dates, peppery figs (slightly), creamy grains, shaved dark chocolate, prune juice, cranberry (slightly), raisins, nutty rum (ron zacapa, maybe), toasted almonds in caramel. 

not as opened as i expected. it's easier to nose neat! that said, very interesting dark/red fruit notes are introduced.

**taste neat:**

honey, toffee, oak, medium tannins, apricot, copper, flint, cinnamon, nutmeg, dark crystallized honey, woody vanilla, juicy raisins, plums, old rum/molasses/muscovado sugar, barrel char, shale, coal. 

expressive and very palatable neat. again, this has the same dna as the 40% expression, which isn't very surprising. everything is just a tad "bigger," if you know what i mean. the dark sweetness takes on dimensions of it's own and is a great feature. the fruit and spice which were missing in the neat nose seem to be back as well.

**taste water:**

cinnamon, cloves, dark honey, jamaican rum, muscovado sugar, raisins, dried cherries, browned apples, varnished oak, almond slivers, dried apricots, bronze, slate.

you get the idea by now.

**finish:**

granite, minerality, bronze, cloves, prunes, raisins, rum, apples, cinnamon.

metallic, mineralic, and slightly fruity. medium duration.

**conclusion:**

consistent nose, palate, and finish.

excellent in all aspects.

nutty, spicy, woody, fruity, metallic, mineralic, on and on...

**rating:** 91/100

a bigger, spicier, somewhat less fruity interpretation of redbreast 12 year old. this, like the 12 year at 40% is fine whisky. i the the 40% for it's fruitiness and easiness, but i also like this cask strength expression for it's depth, spice, and dark, caribbean sweetness. with redbreast it seems you can't go wrong. time to get my hands on the 15 year old...
