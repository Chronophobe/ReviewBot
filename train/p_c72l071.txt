mcadam’s canadian
(80 proof, drank straight)

color: pale orange

nose: citrus peels and vanilla are the first things that come to mind. a few other smells that remind me of woodworking also are present.

taste: orange and vanilla, with a little bit of cocoa in the background.

finish: orange peels, with a slight lingering bitterness at the end.

overall, this is not the most remarkable of whiskies that i have tried. it’s all right as a nice cheap bottle for a night with friends or for someone who’s whiskey budget is very tight, but i’ve had better. i suppose it would make a fair whiskey and ginger ale mixed drink or whiskey and coke, but it’s unremarkable when drank straight.

taste: 50/75 it’s not that it tastes terrible, just unremarkable and lacking a diverse flavour range.

value: 8/15 the low price point (under $10 in the states) is the best thing going for this, but it’s certainly not one that gives much bang for your buck. there are plenty of $10 bourbons and canadians that do better if you are on a tight budget.

uniqueness: 3/5

would i buy again: 2/5 this does not make for a good replacement for my usual go to cheap whiskey, old crow. probably would not buy again.

score: 63/100
