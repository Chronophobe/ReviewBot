hello ww, texacer here with another sample from my northern neighbor:  **collingwood blended canadian 80 proof**.  please be different.

* color: light tan
* nose: light vanilla. buttered biscuit.  
* taste: light caramel.  almost peat. touch of maple.  dry flour. 
* finish: very mellow

not bad for a light one.  smooth.  on the right track here and i'm hopeful that i can find at least one canadian whisky i can love.  but for reference i do only have one irish that i really love.  

&gt;79/100
