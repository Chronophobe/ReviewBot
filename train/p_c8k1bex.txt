**english whisky co. chapter 6, 46% abv (50ml sample)**

*3 year old unpeated english single malt whisky*

i have practically zero english whisky experience. tried an english whisky co. at a bar once, can't remember which one it was (i think it was an earlier chapter). that's it.

* nose: sweet cereal and malt. candle wax/smoke. fresh multigrain bread with honey. vanilla sponge cake with a bit of spice. faint leathery notes and some sandalwood.

* taste: warm and viscous initially, but quickly becomes hot and tangy. grapefruit skin/juice and cayenne pepper. dry oak, fresh ginger and green apples. honey cheerios.

* finish: a little harsh, but not unpleasant. burnt nuts and salted toffee. more pepper, cinnamon and aniseed. medium, slightly bitter and dry.

i'm very surprised by this 3yo english whisky. sure, it lacks refinement and balance, but it's quite tasty! if you like zesty drams with spice, citrus and cereal/malt, you should give this a try. i'm going to order a gift pack that has 200ml of this one, chapter 9 (peated) and chapter 10 (sherry finished). woop woop!
