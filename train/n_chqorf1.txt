tx whiskey is sourced bourbon and blended with sourced american whiskey (distilled to a higher proof than bourbon) aged in used bourbon barrels.  i believe they should be disclosing that this whiskey was sourced from another state than texas.  i've had this and it's a nice whiskey, but it is not a texas product.  if the labeling on the bottle lead one to believe that it was, then that is in violation.

by the way, i have been to f&amp;r and tasted the product they are making themselves (grain to glass all in texas).  we popped the bung on one of their 1st barrels which at the time (aug 2013) was about 18 months old.  it was very good; i was ready to buy a bottle of it right then.  they are saying now it should be released in sometime in 2015 at about 3 years old.
