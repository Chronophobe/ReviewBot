hello worldwhisky, i apologize for the long time between the 15 day and 20 day results but the holidays were busy. the picture is the difference from an un-aged bottle and the 20 day bottle. 

colour: the colour has continually changed as the whiskey aged from clear ([0 days](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/12efn1/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_a_review/)) to pale straw ([4 days](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/14f8zv/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_aged_4_days_a_review/)) to pale gold ([7 days](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/14kxj5/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_aged_7_days_a_review/)) to burnished ([day 15](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/151cr3/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_aged_15_days_a_review/)) and finally a tawny at day 20.

nose: caramel, hay, burnt oak, fresh cut grass and lemon. i was very surprised from these results mostly the addition of strong caramel and oak notes. 

taste: hay, lemon, grass, smoke and oak all come through after 20 days of aging. this is a large improvement over the 15 day tasting. the change this whiskey has under gone it dramatic. 

finish: cereal grains at first then smoke as it lingers (although not too long). 

after 20 days the whiskey is enjoyable. the change this whiskey has under gone it dramatic; from almost undrinkable (day 0) to a dram that is very pleasant (day 20). however, it would have been interesting to try again for longer to see how it evolves.  

i would score this dram 76/100, enjoyable and interesting. i had a lot of fun doing this project and plan on continuing aging whisky in this little barrel.
