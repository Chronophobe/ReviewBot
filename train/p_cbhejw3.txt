**glen breton rare 10 years old**

**glenora distillery, nova scotia, canada**  
  
why not start with a whisky from my good old homeland, or close nonetheless. when one thinks about canadian whisky, one often thinks of rye whiskies whose reputation is as solid as the rockies themselves.  but here comes from nova-scotia a small independent distillery, glenora with the first and to date only canadian single malt, the glen breton.  
  
funny thing, the scotch whisky association actually sued glenora for usage of the word "glen" (from scottish gaelic "gleann", which means “valley”), and that could, according to them, confuse consumers into thinking they were dealing with actual scotch. truth be said that glenora chose this name because the distillery is located in glenville, cape breton. but luckily in 2009 judgment was passed in our favor by the supreme court of canada…  
  
as robert laird borden, canadian prime minister from 1911 to 1920, once said:  
  
&gt;*there is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience. it supercedes all other courts.*  
  
well now that our thirst for knowledge has been quenched, let us take care of another kind of thirst…  
  
when i look at it in front of the light, i would describe its color as a pale gold, close to a haystack.

**nose (19):**  
flowers and vanilla. ginger and honey. a touch of maple, perhaps in my head, a subconcious suggestion coming from the fact that this is a canadian single malt…  
  
**taste (20):**  
syrupy butterscotch. a bit on the soapy side. pleasingly round and filling in the mouth.  
  
**finish (18):**  
lightly smoked grass… followed by a drop of maple sap. sadly too short…  
  
**balance (20):**  
once the glass is empty, you feel like you've just sucked through the straw the last drops of your glass of soda. it's a sad whisky… it goes away too fast.  
  
rumor has it that they make a version of glen breton matured in icewine casks. it's a good homemade cask strength that i would love to get my hands on…  
  
**final score: 77/100**  
  
**87$**
