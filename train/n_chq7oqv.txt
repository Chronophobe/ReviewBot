rather hilly, not terrible but not a jaunt either. an experienced rider shouldn't find it too bad though. the roads often go into single tracks which means you have to keep your ears open for cars approaching from behind or in front to make sure you can let them pass safely. cars are generally very nice to cyclists though, it's not often they'll pass without going into the other lane, they treat you like a car.
