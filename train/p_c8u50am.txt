**bakery hill peated cask strength, 59.8% abv**

thank you to uncletobys for this, my very first sample of australian malt whisky!

* **nose:** rich buttercream , spicy smoke and a bit of menthol. a berry fruit "白酒" note

* **palate:** much more peaty, a bit of honey and cereally sweetness for a second before crackingly dry minerally and volanic peat rush over the tongue. towards the end, a bit of dried strawberry.

* **finish:** rich peaty smoke. honey smoked ham. very full and satisfying. 

* **overall:** this was a bit unusual at first, quite young and spirity at times. it does grow on me quickly, given time. in particular the nose is quite entrancing with its unique smoky-buttercream note. my first australian whisky, this definitely has its own character and is very bold. maybe a bit too much at times but in the right mood really wonderful and eye-opening. 

**i give this a b.** in spite of this dram being most enjoyable, i would struggle to enjoy a whole bottle of this whisky's young and in your face style.
