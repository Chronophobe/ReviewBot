i've visited the distillery and met the distillers behind this last time i was in tasmania, and picked up the sherry matured cask strength when i was there. i thought i'd go for the port matured expression this time.

*overeem port matured cask strength. tasmanian single malt, aged in single port cask (ohd-021) and bottled at 60% abv. paid $150 for 700ml.*

**nose:** the rich christmas cake of lengthy port maturation. quite nutty (almond and macadamia), and alcohol-soaked dried cherries, prunes, and figs. caramel sauce, butterscotch, and vanilla bean. 

**palate:** sweet and winey much like the nose, although now a character of wet oak and malty cereal notes is introduced. there's also a metallic note, although it's not an unpleasant harshness that i usually associate with metallic flavours, but more of a deep brass. complex yet clean, with the body at medium-full. 

**finish:** the fresh vanilla and the dry nuttiness coming to the fore, with the dried fruit notes fading slightly behind (but without disappearing entirely). medium length, and shifting into more of a savoury profile.

i'm clearly forthright with my love for port maturation, and this is another example of how australia is leading the world in that area, as far as i can tell. this tastes young and unbalanced, and could definitely gain from a few more years to smooth it out. nevertheless, it's bold, complex, and tasty, so that's alright with me.

they have a bourbon cask release coming soon. interested to see how that one pans out.

**91/100**
