i was quite pleasantly surprised by alberta premium’s entry-level whisky, an eponymous six-year-old made of 100% rye. alberta premium dark horse canadian whisky is the newest offering from the company (who are owned by beam, but who unfortunately do not export their whiskies outside of canada), a darker, higher-abv, (ostensibly) more strongly flavoured whisky. my guess is that it’s designed to compete with the crown royal black and a few other recent entries in the canadian market of darker, spicier, higher-alcohol whiskies. 

it’s also unique in the alberta premium line-up for not actually being 100% rye—apparently it’s about 8% corn whisky, and about 1% of the product is finished in sherry (rather than oak) casks. again, none of this is on the bottle (it all comes according to davin over at www.canadianwhisky.org), but it also appears to be a blend of 12- and 6-year-old varieties.

it also happens to be pretty good, and for an exceptional price, of $29 cdn.

alberta premium dark horse canadian whisky; nas; 45% abv; presumably chill-filtered and caramel-coloured.

**appearance:** far too dark not to be caramel-coloured (even with a bit of sherry finishing), legs are decent. bottle design is cool and minimalist, for what it’s worth.

**nose:** quite mild at first. i had to cram my nose right down into the glass for a bit before i got anything, but she opens up gradually. oak and oaky vanilla, but well-integrated and almost like a bourbon vanilla than the typical canadian whisky vanilla. toffee, caramel, maple—the standards you seem to get from most canadian whiskies, but again well-integrated, and set off with a nice bit of rye spice. herbal. lavender (?) and other flowers. but also a bit of tang or tartness that’s actually quite nice. charcoal. berries. brown sugar. plums? raisins. the corn and the sherry influence are, i think, both there without being overbearing. lovely. neither the range nor the intensity of the superior lot no. 40, but complex and enjoyable. a couple drops of water really bring out the vanilla/maple/brown sugar and the nice tang, but at the cost of a bit of the complexity in the back.

**taste:** an oddly light mouthfeel, especially considering the abv. peppery and spicy, but not even a hint of alcohol burn. lightly smoky in a way i’m not sure i’ve encountered in a non-scotch whisky. vanilla, clean oak, toffee, maple, caramel. rye spice. sweet, dark and light fruits. still that nice mix of sweetness with a tang. molasses (or brown sugar, maybe?). licorice out of nowhere. again, delightful. for the price point, fabulous. water seems to bring out the fruitiness (raisins, especially) and the rye character a bit more—both the actual quality of the grain and the spiciness of it, but i think this guy might be preferable without.

**finish:** doesn’t go on forever, but respectable. some nice spice, and oak tannins. faint smoke, and charcoal. woodchips. berries and dried, dark fruits after a bit.

**final thoughts:** i’m two-for-two on canadian whisky purchases this past couple of weeks. tasty, robust, complex while still being accessible—a good sipping whisky at an outstanding price. much better and more complex than the entry-level alberta premium (even though i liked that one, too) for a couple bucks more. absolutely worth trying if you can find a bottle, and a reminder to our friends to the south that you shouldn’t be writing off canadian whisky just because of the stuff we traditionally prefer shipping your way. pester beam to start distributing this internationally (or don’t, and leave it all for me).

**score:** 86/100
