pretty big venue with several different area s, but less than about 35 people actually showed.  i don't know if the kings western conference finals a couple miles away at staples center took away from the event, or that ardbeg just isn't that popular,  but there were few people that showed.  other tastings i attended were sold out, this one not so much.

lots of swag for those that came. my wife and i scored 3 shirts, 2 scarves, whistles, flags, pictures,  and too many samples.

the girls with ardbeg 10 samples were offering every few minutes because the lack of attendees,  and i'm not one to say no to free booze.  there was a bartender pouring corryvekkan, ugiedail, and ten year.  he was pouring one ounce or so pours; had about four each.  outside was the cocktail bar; serving ardbeg old fashioned and a couple other cocktails.   we had several of each.  

there was a bbq truck serving food that was free to attendees.  i had brisket and was delicious.  there were games and even a movie room with bean bags to relax on.  after 90 minutes they unveiled the auriverdes.  they were brought out in glass shot glasses (i got four) and was better than i expected.  it was  great night and after shot down the road to little tokyo for more bar hopping.  sobered up with bacon fried rice and and a healthy pour of high west rendezvous rye.  can't wait for next year!
