this is a single malt offering from cedar ridge distillery in swishers iowa. cedar ridge is iowa's first micro distillery, and truly distills spirit (not just bottling ldi product) using german micro-distilling technology. 

their first bourbon was released in 2010 and has been a staple product in their lineup ever since. once the first bourbon barrels were empty, master distiller jeff quint immediately began drawing up plans to use them to create a single malt line. 

the single malt line was initially released this spring in 4 barrel finishes:

* barrel 1 - ex-bourbon, finishing cr port barrel
* 
* barrel 2 - ex-bourbon, finishing cr rum barrel
* 
* **barrel 3 - ex-bourbon, sherry cask (the one i chose)** 
* 
* barrel 4 - ex-bourbon, peat-smoked malt

**color:** pale straw (amber -2)

**nose:**

* honey
* sherry
* vanilla
* malt

the nose on this was by far my favorite (as it typically is in the scotch/whiskey/bourbon experience for me), with bright splashes of honey, sherry, and vanilla. it was as if summer had opened up and arrived in my kitchen a month early.


**palate:**

* thin and oily
* apple
* sherry
* woody vanilla

thin, oily malt covering the tongue brought almost speyside-esque flavors of crisp apple/pear right away. the sherry on this opens up as the spirit hits the mid/back of the palate, and is bright. oaky vanilla hints it's presence throughout.

**finish:**

* short/medium heat
* confectionary sugar
* pear/apple

a shortish finish, with a medium heat that is similar to a slow flash in the mouth. it drys out leaving behind confectionary sugar, and those pear/apple flavors.


**overall:**

a very solid first outing by cedar ridge that reminds me of speyside malts with some fun midwestern character. i do regret not picking up a peaked version of this as well, but will have to get one next time we visit our friends in cedar rapids. these guys are doing some really cool things, and i love that they are distilling it themselves and i love supporting innovative efforts.

because of the flavor profile, this is easily something i would use to introduce friends to the single malt. it has bright flavors, medium complexity, with no scary rough edges. 

the one knock i have on this is the  age (~4 years), low abv, and the (probable) chill-filtering. since this is a thin dram, it would be interesting to see it aged, stronger and opened up a bit more.

* **taste:** 66/75
* **value**: 10/15
* **uniqueness:** 4/5
* **would i buy again:** 4/5

**84/100**
