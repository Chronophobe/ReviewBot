seeing as uncletobys and ecb29 have been reviewing chinese spirits, i think i should give taiwan some representation. if anyone is in doubt, taiwan is **not** part of china. thank you.

**influx brewery "yu hsiang chiao" 御香窖**

**cellar aged red sorghum liquor 窖釀紅高梁酒, 52% abv**

* **nose:** very earthy, rice-wine mould, a hint of bitter (80%+) chocolate. also a slight rice-vinegar zestiness.
quite nice once you get used to it.

* **palate:** a bit harsh initially. some toasted rice and earthy, rooty notes. ginseng. a clean sweetness comes in the middle, before earthy bitterness takes over again.

* **finish:** quite sweet, earthy, and some bitter chocolate again.

**overall:** the nose on this is actually quite pleasant, if a bit unusual at first. the palate brings similar flavours but is somewhat harsh. i didn't finish the rest of this bottle but braised some pork in it instead. it was awesome.
