i'll be drinking these slowly over the several months, but i'm starting with the [caol ila 30 year cask strength collection](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/caol-lla/caol-ila-30-year-old-1983-cask-5301-cask-strength-signatory-whisky/?srh=1).  

edit: the caol ila was very strong and benefited from a bit of water.  firey and quite peaty.
