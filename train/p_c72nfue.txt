how do you find a 21-year-old whisky for under $40?

as it turns out, you head to canada. but a word of caution: though the label on this bad boy proclaims century reserve 21 year old to be a canadian *rye* whisky, this stuff is in fact 100% corn whisky (there is, regrettably, no legislation that dictates what whisky-makers in canada can and cannot call rye).

and though there’s something to be said for the experience of drinking a whisky that would hypothetically be old enough to order itself at a bar, and this stuff isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination (indeed, it’s nice enough), there are much younger, much better, and much better-priced canadian whiskies out there.

**century reserve 21 year old canadian rye whisky**; aged 21 years; 750ml; 40% abv (curses, canadian whisky industry!); paid an astounding $39 at a liquor store in alberta, though this stuff is allegedly supposed to retail for (a still remarkable) $45-50. it’s a product of a small distillery, highwood, based out of alberta. i have my doubts as to whether it’s even widely available anymore, given that the bottle i picked up (a treat for having passed my phd minor field exam) was coated in a somewhat thick layer of dust. and even money would suggest it was *never* available outside canada, at any rate.

**appearance:**  actually might be the first canadian whisky i’ve seen that isn’t caramel coloured. or, if it is so, is done subtly. surprisingly light colour, though. a golden wheat, perhaps.  some legs, but nothing remarkable. the bottle is fairly nice as well.

**nose:** reminds me, oddly, of a less youthful, somewhat tamed canadian club-type profile (which perhaps suggests how much corn is in that particular whisky). smooth—because it’s 100% corn, i think virtually everything here can be chalked up to 21 years in oak. and the oak shows. vanilla, butterscotch, toffee, maple. honey. citrus zest. maybe some peppermint? surprisingly hard to sniff out, and even a drop of water doesn’t really open her up. nice, but nothing really makes it shine.

**taste:**  sweet, smooth. no alcohol burn at all. citrus zest, a bit of spice. woodchips (cedar?). oak. creamy. hard to really pull apart, and a bit lacking in complexity. the usual canadian whisky flavours are pretty muted here, though—vanilla is present but comparatively subtle, at least at first. distant fragrant flowers. honey. dry grains. solid, but ultimately unspectacular.  just a teensy drop of water brings out a bit of a chili-spice that’s nice but is that an off-note of plastic that comes with it? the vanilla starts to pop a bit after fifteen-twenty minutes, which is nice.

**finish:** short. smoothness is really this stuff’s strong point. we obviously tend to be big-flavour nerds here, but there’s definitely a market for something this devastatingly smooth. just  a lot of creamy vanilla, butterscotch, and a bit of lingering oak and cedar. maybe a touch of lemon zest.

**final thoughts:**  worth a try if you’re already well into canadian whiskies, or if you like corn whiskies, and certainly worth considering if you’re on a budget but still after the cachet of a whisky more than two decades old. but there’s better out there—cheaper, younger, more flavourful. in this particular case at least, age is not the be-all and end-all.

**score:** 83
