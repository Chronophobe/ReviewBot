*distilled by bill lark in may 2001 at tasmania distillery. matured 11 years in a port cask (hh0613). bottled in december 2012.*

sample courtesy of ayedfy.

* nose: choc honeycomb. burnt brown sugar. creamy malt. dried dates and sultanas. charcoal and flinty mineral notes. lightly peppered oak with some savoury herbal notes in the background.

* taste: medium-full bodied and oily. resinous and woody. scorched almonds. minty and sweet, turning dry and tannic. chewy toffee. madeira cake. pepper and chilli powder. chocolate-covered liquorice.

* finish: bitter oak tannins. grape skin and orange peel. shortbread and salted crackers. medium length with lingering herbs and spice.

great tasmanian whisky, but my favourite port matured aussie is still sullivans cove port cs.
