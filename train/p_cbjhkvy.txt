**amrut intermediate sherry, 57.1% abv**

*firstly matured in bourbon, then transferred to sherry, then back to bourbon. hence, "intermediate sherry".*

* nose: lots of dried fruits and nuts - sultanas, figs, dates, roasted walnuts and fresh almonds. old oak and cedar. well-worn leather and sweet fermented tobacco. pandan sponge cake. sweet spice and herbs, clove in particular. coconut cream. one of the cleanest sherry noses i've experienced.

* taste: full bodied and viscous. mouth coating and full flavoured. more dried fruits and honeyed nuts. slightly bitter oaky tannins.  golden syrup. a little spicy with some mild chilli and cinnamon. glace ginger. black forest cake. sandalwood and cedar. flowery with citrusy tartness. sweetened black tea. very very faint ethanol in the background and a dry papery taste.

* finish: creme brulee. vanilla essence. a bit leathery, grassy and herbal. white pepper and more chilli. coffee grounds. incense. a whiff of varnish. long, dry and yummy. 

nose is very sweet but warm and welcoming. sweetness on the palate is balanced with spice, acidity and earthy tea notes. finish is long and moreish.

amrut are killing it, every single one i've tried has been 90+. this is a bourbon and sherry explosion with some very interesting flavour combos. a bit rough but who cares?
