i reviewed the [new make spirit from still waters some time ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/18m654/still_waters_canadian_single_malt_new_make/) and what i have here is the 3 year aged version of that product. this is the first cask from a new canadian distillery (a doubly rare occasion!) and i'm so happy to be tasting something actually *new*. it was pretty pricey at $100 cad but as a particularly historic occasion, i couldn't pass up the chance to grab cask #1 from the first new independent ontario distillery in *practically forever*. looking at it in context, a locally made cask strength single malt should probably cost quite a bit anyways.

**colour**: a light amber, not unlike a lighter maple syrup. rather short legs in the glass but the real attraction is the fine particulate which shows that this is not a filtered and coloured product. love the signs of authenticity already. definitely no additional colouring in this one.

**nose**: this is still a pretty canadian nose with a strong wave of "copper" (lot 40 and wiser's legacy fans know what i'm talking about!) and vanilla from the oak - but this time there is no familiar spiciness from other grains. i smell oak, grapes, honey and sugar (brown sugar, molasses?). after a few minutes in the glass, i can really start to smell that new make spirit i reviewed some time ago. this is a fascinating experience now that i can compare an aged spirit to the unaged 'original'. i could nose this for much longer but it'd start to *get weird*.

**taste**: wish a splash of water to lessen the impact of the heavy alcohol content, the first taste is a very heavy and oily spirit with a big oak presence. this isn't light and sweet like the traditional canadian whisky, this liquid is much heavier and more viscous - if i can use the term. a second taste has the now familiar grapes and dark fruit return. the huge alcohol content is barely apparent now but the youth of the whisky starts to become obvious when there isn't anything else coming on the palate other than the first bursts of grapes, raisins, honey and oak. this would be very fascinating after 10 years in a barrel.

this is a single malt - of course - but i don't think these are the sort of flavours you'd get from a scottish product. it's becoming more apparent to me how differences in process and location can fundamentally change and define a product. how is it that distilled barley can taste so different between places?

**finish**: very long for such a young whisky. there's no heat like you'd expect from a rye blend, only a long-lasting impression of oak and barley. none of the 'medicinal' nature that i mentioned in the new make review is here. the oak has refined away so many harsh flavours after only 3 years!  

**conclusion**: i couldn't be happier that still waters' first whisky has been such a refined success. this bottle is both a quality product and a very promising first step. canadian club and crown royal could learn a lot about self-respect, authenticity and quality from these 2 guys who just wanted to make a good whisky.

this is obviously a very young whisky so the complexity isn't necessarily there, but i'm overjoyed that i am able to pay for a quality product from people who wanted to make it their own way. the craft whisky business is taking off in so many places and it looks like canada is right there with everybody else. still waters distillery is going to keep making some good stuff and i can only hope that one day people outside of the province and country have a chance to get their hands on it. it's simply brilliant that i can get an amazing small-batch single malt whisky from so many new countries and be assured that they're all unique and true winners. everybody should take the effort to step outside their whisky 'comfort zone' and try something they once derided or thought 'boring' and 'inferior'.

**score 87/100**  
*this will be a brilliant whisky when it's older. for now, it's a very promising young single malt with a simple palate and great attention to detail.*
