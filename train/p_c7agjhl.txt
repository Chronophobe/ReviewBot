here`s the thing; i've lived my whole life in canada, so when i originally came to /r/scotch, and read someone saying alberta premium was a great rye, i laughed. i always knew alberta premium as the plastic big bottle that was cheap and mostly drank by alcoholics. granted i've only lived in ontario and quebec, so perhaps part of that is subtle racism for alberta growing up. 

i finally gave in after hearing people say **alberta premium dark horse** as the rye to buy.

and well, i'm glad i did, because this is a really good rye.

here's a description i found for alberta premium dark horse rye:

&gt;a mingling of 12-year-old rye whisky and 6-year-old small pot rye, dark horse has an 8% dollop* of well-aged corn whisky added to flesh out the body. the whisky is aged in heavily charred american white oak barrels, and is bottled at 45% alc/vol. 

**colour:** dark maple syrup

**alcohol %:** 45

**price:** $29.95 (cad)

**country of origin:** the people`s majestic canuckastan (alberta, canada)

**nose:** strawberries, floral notes, bay leaf, alcohol burn, anise, toffee oak. wow, right out the gate this is a complex nose. there's still that sweetness you expect from canadian whiskey  however there's almost a speyside mixed in.

**taste:** brown sugar, espresso, sour cherry, caramel, black forest cake, cinnamon, ginger. the flavours come on very strong, like christmas in your mouth. it's less sweet than other ryes, and really delivers a great middle of the road flavour.

**finish:** oak, nutmeg, cherry, cassia buds, bacon, earthiness, pepper. not too long, and i almost feel like the rye has been watered down, as i really wish that finish would last longer.

**conclusion:** well, i was wrong about alberta premium. this is a great rye that everyone should try, as this is one of the best i've ever tried. the port finish adds so much complexity, and overall really makes this a go-to dessert drink. it could be still somewhat cloying for some people, however as i have a huge sweet tooth, it's great for me.

**86/100**
