**nose:** dessert sweetness the first thing to greet you, with creamy butterscotch sauce, raw barley sugar, overripe banana, and vanilla custard. crisp and somewhat sharp fruitiness of pear and lemon tart.

**palate:** medium body leaning towards full. still creamy in the texture, but a more fruity flavour profile, with a citrus acidity of grapefruit and passionfruit, as well as an interesting berry character of strawberry syrup and plum sauce. 

**finish:** continuation of the fruit sauces and syrups from the palate, and moving back towards the dessert-y nose of fresh honey and apple strudel. malty cereal notes and a hint of peppery oak lingering later in the medium length.

starward's youth is evident, however there seems to be quite a decent base that should improve well with more time and experimentation. the casks here are quite different to the traditional sherry style, but they work. flavour profile reminds me of a more complex and berry-driven glenrothes.

i read that one of the goals these new distillers have is to develop a whisky with a ["uniquely australian mash bill"](http://www.nicks.com.au/product/view/starward-single-malt-whisky-%28700ml%29/489339). i can't wait to see (and taste!) if that comes to fruition.

**80/100**
