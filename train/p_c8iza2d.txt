**connemara peated, 40% abv**

*peated irish single malt whiskey*

i have practically zero irish whiskey experience. tried jameson at a pub once, didn't really like it. that's it.

* nose: earthy and peaty. cigarette smoke and very faint burnt plastic. briny and lemony. pine cones, honey and some cereal.

* taste: thin and harsh. instant coffee. pine and endive. preserved lemon and some honey. cigarette tar. sort of ashy.

* finish: ethanol harshness. bitter burnt rubber. short to medium, yeasty and medicinal.

it was *okay.* drinkable neat and i'd glad i tried it. nose was decent, but the taste and finish were kind of crappy.  the bitterness was interesting... although when combined with the harshness on the palate, the dram almost became unbearable.

i still want to try more irish whiskeys, but only samples or minis.
