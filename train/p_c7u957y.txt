moved from r/scotch for obvious reasons.

before the holidays i abruptly lost residency of my apartment due to a fire in the building.  it's still being cleaned up from all the smoke damage, so my vacation has been extended slightly.  i had planned on being out of town for christmas/new year's anyway.  my stuff's covered by renters insurance, but i felt weird about leaving 15 bottles out for the cleaners/adjusters/squatters to have their way with.  i took the redbreast with me, as the last thing i wanted to smell in a drink anymore was smoke.  the other bottles are staying with a trusted friend.    

the bottles in the picture are sitting on top of a white refridgerator.

here's my third review:

**redbreast 12 cask strength** single pot still irish whiskey - 57.7%abv, 750ml shipped from astorwines.com for $64*1.08

sampled in a large snifter in my parents' basement

* color:  pale honey

* nose:  clean and sweet, dark fruits, lemon zest, flowers and malt, very bright and intense but not overbearing 

* taste:  opens in waves of malt and spice, continues with light fruits carried in a medium-intense body, the sweetness of the sherry casks is on display and very welcome. 

* finish: outstandingly smooth for cs, lingers with more of the floral notes hinted at before, sweet malt at the end.

this is delightful.  rich taste, extraordinary balance, and good strength.  i don't know that i've ever had a bad experience with a cask strength whisk(e)y.  i need to find more.

overall:  93/100
