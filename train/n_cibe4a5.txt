i'm a shit describer, but it is definitely up there on the scale of how much you can enjoy it as an experience. at $42 you arent breaking the bank on that first nicer paycheck. smoother than most 90 proofs even though it's a 110 proof rye. in wine terms it has nice legs, and is a real treat to swirl around in your glass. the bottle looks great on the shelf too. 

edit: and i just got some kick-ass grades that were better than i expected. apparently i'm pretty good at describing tectonic processes and identifying minerals under a microscope. 

edit 2. if you got it in your area i really like elmer t. lee, i swear it's like baby blanton's for $20+ less
