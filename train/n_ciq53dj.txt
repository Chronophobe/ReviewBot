this is the application for the label that will go on the bottle. since it's public and has to be applied for long before the actual bottling, these documents are a good way to find out about alcohol before it is announced or released. i don't know how he finds it but sku of sku's recent eats browses all the applications and posts them. i believe he does so because he maintains a comprehensive list of all american distilleries.
