**lost spirits distillery: leviathan i**

* **color:** deep brown amber
* **nose:** thick red wine, earthy mushroom peat, chocolate
* **palate:** red wine, red hot cinnamon candy, earthy peat, hint of black licorice, nutmeg?
* **finish:** mushroom peat, lingering red wine, slight bitterness
* **rating: 89/100**

really quite unique and brilliant stuff for being so young. it was something i had never had when drinking single malts up to this point. overall it was very different from the peated expressions that come out of scotland, but just as good. it reminded me of trying the kilchoman machir bay for the first time and being impressed that a young whisky can show so much refinement and promise. i hope to one day try an older expression from lost spirits, but until then i will remain a loyal fan.
