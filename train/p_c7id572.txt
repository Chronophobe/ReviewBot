hello again worldwhisky, here is 15 days of aging from my wigle aging kit with wheat whiskey. i intended to do a review at age 14 days but couldn’t fit it in yesterday. the link is to another aging kit for those not in pittsburgh and might want to try this yourself. 

colour: the colour has changed from pale straw (4 days) to pale gold (7 days) to burnished (day 15).

nose: fresh cut hay, grass and lemon. over the last week the nose has become much less astringent and mellower. adding just a drop or two of (ultra-pure) water has released caramel notes and much need sweetness. 

taste: hay, lemon, grass and woody notes. wow, i must say this is very interesting and pleasant to drink. it is not surprising that the dominate tastes are cereal grains given that it is a wheat whisky and has generally mellowed. there is still some alcohol bite but not nearly as pronounced as before. unlike the nose, which improved with water, the taste has become bland and washed out with only hints of hay, lemon and caramel…i might have added too much but very hard to tell. 

finish: cereal grains. what little alcohol finish that was present at day 7 still remains but is much smoother. adding water just diluted the finish.

after 15 days the whiskey is drinkable but still lacks complexity. the addition of water did improve the dram but overall there is not much to say about the whiskey. i suppose this is a product of the whiskey itself and not the aging process. i am not sure i will get much more out of aging further but will do a final review towards the end of this week. 

aging 15 days i would score this dram 70/100, drinkable but not very complex or satisfying (if interesting). i do not think there will be much improvement after ageing for 15 days but we will see in a few.
