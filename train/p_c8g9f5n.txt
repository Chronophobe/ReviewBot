**slyrs - bavarian single malt whisky - 8yo - 43%**

*price*: ~30â‚¬ for a 0,7l bottle. you can get them once a year if you're lucky and have a good dealer that reserves you a bottle ;)

*appearance*: premium, straight, not too invasive, also good as a gift

*color*: dark gold, a little amber

*in the glass*: looks like honey, pretty oily

*nose*: creamy, smooth, full of caramel and vanilla, no peat or smoke

*palate*: sweet, warm, fullfilling the mouth, explosion of caramel and vanilla, a little sirup

*finish*: stays a little but not too long, honey, a little fruity at the tip of the tongue. pretty good with a piece of dark chocolate

*conclusion*: a good whisky to start with or for beginners. it has all the typical attributes of scotch and a wide character. really smooth and rich for a 8 year old whisky. not penetrating, no pepper, peat, smoke or something, absolutely no feel of spirits.
