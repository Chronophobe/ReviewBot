hello again!

once again i am back with an update on the range of malt whisky that i stock in my store. i choose each malt myself by seconding on different factors:
-what sells well, so i may choose malts from the same brewery just different varieties.

-what is on offer so i can sell back at a good price to the customer.

-i may personally love the malt, love the box.

-what other stores stock

i tend to keep the same margin on every malt (a few exceptions) and this margin is very low, we do not make much money from them. this brings customers into the store and they may purchase other things along with it. we try to price very competitively but of course we may not be the cheapest for some of them but across the range i am very confident in saying we are the cheapest place you will find.

my range is still completely inferior to my dads store sadly but because of licensing laws in scotland it will never be as big as his due to restricted space.

if you have any questions at all i will answer them for you!
