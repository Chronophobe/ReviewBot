**hakushu 12 years, 43% abv**

this japanese malt took me a while to get round to. i had often neglected it in favour of its heavier cousin yamazaki. oh what i was missing! 

as with many japanese whiskies, this is a vatting of several spirit styles and casks (lightly peated, heavily peated, bourbon cask, sherry cask etc..). i think the japanese really do a great job of "engineering" a whisky in this way. hakushu (and yamazaki) also bottle these individual styles as special releases, and they are great but about triple to quadruple the price!... not an everyday dram. anyway, on with the review!

**nose:** quite light, floral and oily, with a slight grassy/cucumber note. lightly roasted coffee beans.


**palate:** some light fruits and orange peel at first, then a gentle woody smoke and lightly honeyed maltiness. nutty oak and a bit of peppery spice also.


**finish:** the smoke grows (but still subtle, a distant bonfire). dry maltiness, dried citrus peel. again a grassy note. not so complex but nice and long.


**overall:** this is a wonderful malt that combines a light floral/grassy character with subtle peat. recommended to try, and even to buy!


**i give it an a, will probably pick up another bottle in the future sometime**
