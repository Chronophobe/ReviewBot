another one from my recent /r/scotchswap 'ping with geofitz4. amrut peated single malt, 46% abv, natural color, unchillfiltered.

* **color:** yellowish.

* **nose:** assertive. peat, grain, dried fruit, damp leaves.

* **taste:** lots of peat all right, but its a very "green" vegetal peat as opposed to a smokey peat. reminds my of the peat in longrow for anyone who's tried that. nuts, fresh fruit, honey. plenty of oak too, but it's more of a fresh, toasted oak character, almost a little bourbon-y. no lack of bold flavors here.

* **conclusion/score:** this one just didn't really do it for me. i could tell that the quality was there, but something just seemed a bit off to me. the only other amrut i've had is the unpeated cask strength, which i definitely enjoyed more. it seems for me personally the peat doesn't really complement the baseline amrut flavor profile. 75/100
