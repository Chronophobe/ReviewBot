after reading davin de kergommeaux's excellent book canadian whisky: the portable export, i was inspired to review something canadian. the book is hard to put down and i learned a lot, with respect to both the history and methodology of canadian whisky. i  fear that i may have only reviewed three canadian whisky so far, the very good wiser's 18, crown royal black, and the very sweet forty creek barrel select. this will have to change (call it my resolution). to begin to kick things off, i'll review the very affordable and very available canadian mist from the canadian mist distillery in collingwood, ontario. the distillery also produces a more upscale whisky called collingwood. very straightforward.

**canadian mist**

**color:** amber +1 (lots of caramel, a common factor in most canadians)

**abv:** 40%

**aroma neat:**

toasted marshmallow, vanilla extract, hard butterscotch candy, acetone (slightly), maple/caramel-coated oak, sweetish corn meal/mash, fresh grapefruit (a touch).

sweet and smooth, which is the intended effect. it probably won't enthrall a whisky geek, but it is sure to please beginners or those who prefer sweeter, more gentle smells. the nose is best after a few minutes, with somewhat unctuous and gooey sweetness.

**aroma water:**

thick caramel, maple syrup, powdered sugar/marshmallows, corn mash/corn bread, cooked cereals, vanilla, dutch cocoa powder (very subtle), musty wood/old sawdust, cinnamon applesauce (quietly). 

i hate using "maple syrup" with canadian whisky. i usually wonder if it's all in my head, but it's very prominent here. surprisingly, the sweetness becomes a bit darker and more grain notes emerge.

**taste neat:**

cracked corn/corn meal, toasted marshmallows/vanilla, ground pepper (softly), dry oak (not very tannic, though), diced red apples.

plenty of fresh corn comes through clear as day, before sweeter notes (including more tasty marshmallow) surface. traces of fruit and spice are evident as well. a very light and sweet style, as alluded to by the nose.

**taste water:**

honeyed popcorn, cinnamon/pepper spice (slightly), caramel, rum-soaked oak, brown sugar, marzipan (slightly), vanilla (slightly bitter).

the mouthfeel starts to become perilously thin with a few drops of water, but the flavors don't retreat so easily, especially crisp corn. a pleasant surprise.

**finish:**

tame spice (nutmeg), grapefruit pith, caramel, toasted oak.

short, as is expected for a young, caramelized blended whisky at 40%. not unpleasant while it lasts. the grapefruit notes which hide a bit too deeply in this whisky are delicious when detectable.

**conclusion:**

easy, admittedly simple nose, with traditionally canadian sweet notes.

corn heavy palate that is actually rather expressive. it even takes a little water well.

short, but cleansing palate.

**rating:** 78/100

certainly, canadian mist is a good whisky. i consider it a good entry point to canadian whisky, since it's very beginner-friendly, even for a canadian. it's also 10-15 usd a bottle, so it's low risk. i probably wouldn't drink this too regularly because it's a little to easy and simple for my personal tastes, but canadian mist isn't meant for that purpose anyway. it's good for what it is, easy sippin' and mixin' whisky, and is much better than i expected. if this was a bit more robust, it would easily bust into the 80's.
