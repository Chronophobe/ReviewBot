sounds very, very plausible about delays due to the lcbo process. 

especially if lcbo ordered the 2003 vintage based on a specific catalog number, and things took into the next year to get tested/approved. after the whole process, heaven hill wouldn't be able to just "switch" to a new label, without generating a bunch of paper work, but still needed to use 2004 barrels.

if that's the case, then if there's any trend in taste based on vintage, this would likely fall into the 2004 camp...

although, why they decided to send ontario the french-only rear labels, i have no idea.
