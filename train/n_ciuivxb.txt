the proof is a prime indicator that it is coming from warehouse locations used in previous releases before 2013 and as such should taste closer to those releases. the 2013 came from lower warehouse floors which made the proof lower. personally i didn't think it lived up to the previous releases so seeing this proof has me excited.
