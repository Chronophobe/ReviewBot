**bakery hill peated cask strength, 59.8% abv**

this is an australian single malt whisky from victoria, more info [here.]( http://www.bakeryhilldistillery.com.au/the-distillery.aspx)

* nose: sweet pungent peat smoke. ripe stone fruits and coconut cream. honey, cinnamon and bay leaves. toasted marshmallows. salami and white pepper.

* taste: hot! mouth-coating oiliness. salted butter, honey and vanilla. sweet and malty with some fruity peatiness, followed by a pinch of salt and a lot of pepper and spice.

* finish: charred oak, stewed fruits and sweet bbq smoke. clove and aniseed. long, peppery, dry and numbing.

this is my favourite australian whisky. the nose is fantastic, but the taste and finish can do with a bit of refinement and roundedness. i don't mind though; this dram has strong punchy flavours, and hot and spicy deliciousness. great stuff!
