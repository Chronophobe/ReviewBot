try it--probably bourbon.  chichibu is the new distillery founded by the hanyu guy's kid, and hanyu is all gone, which explains the labels:

&gt; chichibu is japan’s newest distillery and the first to be built in the country since the mid 1970’s. the distillery is located in the town of chichibu, close to the city of saitama and about 2 hours to the north west of tokyo. the idea of chichibu’s founder ichiro akuto was to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps and build and operate a distillery. his grandfather had established the hanyu distillery in 1946. hanyu ceased production in 2000 and has since been dismantled, with ichiro akuto owning most of the remaining whisky stock. he bottles and releases these under the ‘ichiro’s malt’ label. akuto intends to continue bottling this hanyu stock while the new whisky from chichibu is maturing. there will also be occasional releases of the new unaged spirit.
