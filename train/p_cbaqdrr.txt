australia (tasmania). 40% abv. aged in american and french oak.

* **color:** pale amber.
* **nose:** sweet and floral. tropical fruits, especially guava. possibly some coconut.
* **palate:** different. dense, almost chewy, with a decent bite. baking spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger. some oak.
* **finish:** stops a little short but it does open up over time. cocoa and peppermint. slightest alcohol odor, but it's easy to ignore.

score: 85/100

this was my first experience with australian whisky and i wasn't sure what to expect but it's pretty good. very refreshing. the nose is absolutely amazing. i don't get the impression that it's very old and i'd love to see what happens to it over time. 

sidebar: does anyone know what happens to whisky as it ages in tasmania? is it like scotland, where it loses more alcohol than water, or like kentucky, where it works the other way around?
