ahhh duty free what would a scotch drinker do without it?  i picked up this bottle in tokyo on my way back from thailand.  it was about 15000Â¥ or about $150 cad for 700ml at 43%.  the only other japanese whisky i have had is the yamazaki 10.  this one is less mature than i would have expected from an 18 year old.  good but not my favorite "world whisky".

colour: cherry wood, dark

nose: oak, caramel, dark cherries, a bit of vanilla.  sherry?  i could just be crazy.

palate: sweetness, definitely some fruit there, i swear i taste sherry everything on the box is in japanese which i cannot read so i can't confirm if this was aged in sherry casks. i taste the oak as well.

finish: smooth and long the oak flavour comes on strong here and is complimented by a summer fruit taste as well.

overall a nice whisky, too much money for the quality though and probably too difficult to get in canada.  75/100

edit: too many 0s
