hello worldwhisky, here is 7 days of aging from my wigle aging kit with wheat whiskey.

colour: the colour has changed from pale straw ([4 days](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/14f8zv/wigle_white_wheat_whiskey_aged_4_days_a_review/)) to pale gold (7 days)

nose: fresh cut hay, grass, lemon and fennel (hard to say). the nose has continued to mellow over the last 3 days and i am starting to get some woody notes in addition to the cereal that was so abundant before.

taste: hay, lemon, grass and like the nose some unidentifiable woody notes. the taste continues to mellow and becoming more drinkable each time. 

finish: cereal grains. the alcohol finish has all but disappeared but still the finish, like the taste, lacks complexity. 

after 7 days the whiskey is just about drinkable. although not yet developing much depth or complexity it is surprisingly good and at this stage would be suitable for mix (especially in apple cider). 

aging 7 days i would score this dram 65/100, which is a larger improvement than in the first 4 days. because i do not want to drink too much of this before i am satisfied, my next review will be at 14 days (sunday december 15th).
