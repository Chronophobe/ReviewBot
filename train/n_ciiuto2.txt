so this was posted on another site. 
only details i saw was they are $80 each and as you can see, there is a bourbon and a rye. supposedly 4-5 year. 
i know most of us saw the ttb a while back and heard the news of moving to an oregon source. well, here it is! apparently..  
anyone seen or heard anything? going to have to see some reviews before i pop on something new like this.
