these reviews are from a while back (as you may tell) - a tasting i did under the christmas tree!


------------------------------
**green spot single pot still, 40% abv**


* **nose:** a mixture of malty barley + fresh cereal notes mixed with a grassy lemony freshness. melon-flavoured candy. reminds me a bit of auchentoshan valinch.

* **palate:** very rich cereals and creamy oak filling the mouth, a real burst of barley. slightly lemony, orange blossom, more vanilla and cream coming at the end. wonderful.

* **finish:** fresh cereal notes remain on the palate along with some creamy citrus + vanilla. 

**i give this an a+** i really love this flavour profile, and i endeavour to make sure i am never far from a bottle of green spot

**redbreast 12 years old, 40% abv**


* **nose:** very clean, dry minerally grain spirit. a hint of fresh green apple skin. opens up with more fruity oak and malt after a while. reminds me of jamesons.

* **palate:** raisins, nice spicy european oak, some vanilla and teacake. a clean, crisp grain note cuts through the middle.
 
* **finish:** creamy vanilla oak and smooth grain sweetness. touch of oak spice.


**grade b from me!** kind of a more refined and rounded jamesons. nothing mind blowing in my opinion.

**powers gold label 12 special reserve, 46% abv**


* **nose:** ripe fruits - banana &amp; apple. oaky cocomut and vanilla notes. sharp barley sugars and a rich cereal note after a while.

* **palate:** big bourbon oak influence, banana, coconut, a creamy mouthfeel. more fruity in the middle with pineapple, banana and sweet malty/graininess.

* **finish:** banana, barley sugar. very clean and smooth.

**good enough for an a** i won't seek this one out. it is very enjoyable, but i consider the green spot to have more complexity.
