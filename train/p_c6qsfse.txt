i just picked up a bottle of the new (and legendary) 'lot no. 40 singer copper pot still canadian whisky (2012 edition)' from the lcbo here in ontario and let's just say i've been waiting a long time to see if this stuff lives up to its reputation.

consumed with a tiny 3 or 4 drops of water.

**nose**

sazerac and rittenhouse combined, but better? a coma-inducing nose. i wish every canadian whisky fan could smell this fantastic whisky. there's a huge rye right up front, but later still some candy and fruit arrives. something this good is hard to put into words. rye doesn't get any more flavourful than this - and i haven't even drank any of it yet! this is the greatest canadian whisky for nosing since the 30 year old version of alberta premium.

**palate**

this is fantastically warm and 'smooth'. the intense pepper and spice makes one completely forget that there is any alcohol present in the glass, despite it being 43%. the spicy heat seems to never end, but it's not fiery and uncomfortable like danfield's 12yo or alberta premium. just breathing after a single sip is a real treat, more flavours appear out of thin air. this is a luscious liquid, unlike the thin wiser's deluxe or canadian club 6yo. oak and rye is a fantastic combination and i've never tasted a better combination. this is canadian whisky on the big stage of flavour. rye, oak, spice, toffee, fruitiness, it's all here.

**finish**

as mentioned above, the heat is comforting and good-natured. it sticks around for much longer than most canadian fans are used to, and it is appreciated. right near the end i can't help but taste barley, but it's obviously not in this bottle. if i had known that the finish would be this warm and last so long, i wouldn't have spent such a long time nosing the damn thing!

**conclusion**

i'd go out and buy a truckload of rye bread right now if i wasn't watching my svelte figure.

this is an unbelievable bottle for a really reasonable price (if you can find it). if you americans can get your hands on a sazerac straight rye or the rittenhouse straight rye, you should have a very good grasp of what lot 40 is like.

i can't gush any more about this product or else corby distillery will have to pay me. remarkable. if this is the future for canadian distilleries, you guys better get on board right now!

fantastic in every category.

**95/100**
