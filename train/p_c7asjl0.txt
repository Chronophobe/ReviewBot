i can't post this in /r/scotch since it's not a scotch... but here's my third advent calendar review, 4th ever.

yamazaki 18
japanese single malt

43% abv

~$170

**color:** dark amber

**nose:** sherry, slight oak, maple?

**taste:** surprisingly thick, sweet, little smokey, slight honey and sherry

**finish:** the oak comes out more, pretty warming, 

**comments:** i'm almost certain i'm not doing this whisky justice.  there just has to be more to the finish that i'm not picking up.  


**score:** 90
