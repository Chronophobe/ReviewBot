i've only found very limited information on this bottle.  i'm mostly trying to determine if this bottle is the same as the one on this [site](http://www.lionswhisky.com/whisky/haig___haig_five_star_tin_cap.php).  also the bottle has been open for who knows how long, does that hurt its value at all?
