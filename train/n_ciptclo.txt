thanks, it's really nice to have been able to see the process and try these before buying them. if you ever get the chance to visit scotland and do some tours, i recommend it!

we stumbled upon this "friends of the classic malts" thing where you sign up for free and get a passport type booklet which gives you free entry to a tour and tasting at 12 distilleries throughout scotland (and you get a prize if you visit all 12!). it was a great thing to have and allowed us to visit far more distilleries than we had planned on.

the only ones out of the 12 "classic malts" we didn't visit are the lagavulin and caol ila distilleries on islay and the talisker distillery. we will definitely do that some day though. (we're from belgium, so scotland isn't that hard or expensive to reach)
