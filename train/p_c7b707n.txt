repost from last night which i accidentally put in /r/scotch.  from day iii of my advent calendar.

connemara peated (40% abv, irish single malt):

**nose:** pinecones, tar, turpentine, pumpkin pie, grass, and something slightly fruity (tangerine?). a touch farmy. vanilla in the background. smells dusty and floral, dandelions and old warehouse.

**taste:** antique wood, gingerbread, and herbal/floral notes. a touch of flowery rye, although it is very musty, like a very old attic. slightly cardboardy.

**finish:** light peat smoke, black pepper, and a bit of coriander. it is not spicy, but rather mild spiced flavors mix with wood and flowers. buttered corn and violets. soft and finishes with some iodine/rubbery notes.

**final notes:** a whiskey quite unlike anything i've ever had. it really doesn't resemble any islays or other peated malts i've had, although there is a passing glimpse of bowmore in here. i can't say i hate it, it's rather unique and not harsh or terribly off-putting. some of the notes are just so different that it would take me several glasses to get used to this. it certainly has a very watery mouthfeel and would benefit from a higher abv, possibly granting it several more points on my score. very drinkable, but not something i'd seek out.

**final score: 83/100**
