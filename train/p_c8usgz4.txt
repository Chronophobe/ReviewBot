time for the black sheep of /r/worldwhisky. received this as a generous christmas gift from my girlfriend's brother and his fianc√©e.

*canadian club classic. canadian blended whisky, aged 12 years in re-charred bourbon barrels. local bottle price: $40 for 700ml.*

**nose:** brown sugar, molasses, vanilla essence, carpet cleaner. strong, metallic alcohol note.

**palate:** light-medium bodied, very sweet, maple syrup and more brown sugar. still quite metallic but not entirely unpleasant.

**finish:** maaaaple syrup, and that metallic note still hanging around unfortunately. rum-like molasses from the nose. quite short, slightly creamy, more vanilla on the tail. 

not a lot happening but if it wasn't for that metallic note, this wouldn't be too bad. could be perfectly acceptable as a mixer, perhaps even on ice.

**57/100**
