just wanted to put the shout out here to /u/whiskeybrown. awesome dealing with you sir! i don't know that i'll have a review up at any point very shortly, however, it will be there eventually. i'm thinking i'd like to add the 12 ncf and maybe the 16 to my set and then do a full aberlour flight, including the a'bunadh batches i have currently.
