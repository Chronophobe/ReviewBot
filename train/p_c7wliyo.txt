good evening /r/worldwhisky! caterpillar here with my triumphant return to reviews! i’ve been away for a while due to life generally being less fun than the internet. i was lucky enough to have my friend and fellow /r/scotch moderator singlemaltwhisky send me four samples of whisky he had aged himself in addition to nine (yes that’s right, nine) mystery drams that are yet to be reviewed! i’m hopefully going to be starting my own home aging experiment in the coming months and wanted to see the progression expectation beforehand.

**new make whisky**

* color: crystal clear
* nose: ethanol. light grain, wheat, and indistinct sour note. 
* taste: sour. big ethanol. unrefined, grainy, and rough. there’s a bit of a sour grape/raisin quality. very light and surprisingly nonoffensive.
* finish: ethanol burn, very short, dry.
* overall: grainy, youthful, ethanol, and completely unrefined. exactly what i expected. the building blocks to a great whisky.

**aged 7 days**

* color: gold
* nose: ethanol. very light oak, sour mash, and sweet vanilla if you really reach. the ethanol still overpowers. clears out the nostrils better than vicks.
* taste: ethanol, sour mash, dried raisins, faint toasted oak, pepper.
* finish: short. much more mellow than the new make, even after only 7 days. this is where you actually get a nice bit of sweetness, oak, and vanilla. the ethanol is there but not as pronounced.
* overall: after only 7 days, the whisky has really began to change drastically. the ethanol is cut down significantly and there is a touch of sweetness coming through. it reminds me a bit of evan williams. not a lot there, but nothing terrible either.

**aged 60 days**

* color: copper
* nose: wheat, charred oak, allspice, sour mash, roasted vanilla bean, cinnamon, citrus sweetness.
* taste: warm, big toasted oak, layers of vanilla, honey and orange rind, warm baking bread, pear, drunken apples, and bittersweet chocolate.
* finish: long, dry, very sweet apple pie. wonderful.
* overall: the difference 53 days makes in incredible. this is a truly refined whisky. the nose reminds me a bit of elijah craig with that great mash note and oak sweetness, but the taste and finish are a beast all their own. this is a thing of beauty.

**aged 75 days**

* color: deep copper
* nose: mellow oak, vanilla, warm apple pie, corn mash, sweet bread.
* taste: spicy, charred oak, vanilla bean, orange rind, drunken apples, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chocolate.
* finish: long, spiced, and oak. the last 15 days helped for sure, but not a big leap.
* overall: this is exactly what i was hoping from with a home-aged whisky. the difference between the new-make and the finished product is absolutely astounding. just a few short months and this has gone from an unrefined corn mash to a terrific whisky. absolutely incredible. this last one is a definite sipper. it would go perfectly with a nice fire on a cold night.

i consider myself very lucky to have been awarded the chance to sample singlemaltwhisky’s hard work in turning this new make into a wonderful whisky. the last two glasses really blew me away. i could easily see myself purchasing an entire bottle of either. i’ve decided not to give any ratings for these whiskies, as these were more for the measurable changes in nose, taste, and finish rather than overall rating. if you’re considering trying your own experiment, i would say you definitely should, because this is wonderful.
