a little preamble:

it is my birthday. today actually. 

my plan for a while was to get myself a bottle of scotch that was distilled in 1988, the year i was born, for my birthday. and i figured that since it would represent dropping quite a bit more money than normal on one bottle, i should be careful, and try samples rather than just crossing my fingers on a Â£100+ bottle.

boy was that a good idea!

i've reviewed these 5 over the sum of 3-4 separate days, with some gaps inbetween, where i had 1 or 2 per night, not wanting to overwork my palette on such fancy tipples. so the notes were obviously written before i made up my mind.

in the end, it was a bit of a bust, and none of the samples blew me away enough to justify their price tags.

here's the tl;dr: 

* **balmenach** 25 year old 1988 - signatory cask strength collection - **89**/100
* **highland park** 25 year old, 1988, signatory cask strength collection (cask 759) - **87**/100
* **tamdhu** 25 year old, 1988, old malt cask (hunter laing) - **87**/100
* **benrinnes** 24 year old 1988, montgomerie's rare select - **72**/100
* **aberlour** 25 year old, 1988, old malt cask (hunter laing) - **66**/100

(the order in which i reviewed them was: balmenach, aberlour, tamdhu, benrinnes, highland park)

in the end, i was left unimpressed enough to abandon the sentimental idea of getting something from 1988, and instead decided to for a bottle of laphroaig 18, and a bottle of aberlour 12 ncf. which combined was still cheaper than everything except the balmenach, and means i have some birthday money left over for, i dunno, maybe i can put it towards the next bottle i buy!

incidentally, these are reviews 24 through 28.
