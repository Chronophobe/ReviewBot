trader joe's has a single malt irish whisky and it only cost's 20 usd! after hearing good things on sku's blog, i ran out to my local trader joe's to grab some. while i was waiting to check out, multiple people told me how good the whisky was. i've got great expectations.

it's worth noting that this is a single malt irish whisky, as opposed to a pure pot still whisky. all this means is that the whisky is made from 100% malted barley, just like a single malt scotch whisky. pure pot still whisky is made from a mix of unmalted and malted barley and is an irish style that arose because tax was less on unmalted barley. this whisky is double distilled, which is another similarity with scotch. most irish whisky is triple distilled. so, this is a pretty interesting bottle already. let's give it a try!

**trader joe's single malt irish whisky**

**color:** amber +0 (probably a touch of e150a, but it's not slaughtered like jw black, for instance)

**abv:** 40%

**aroma neat:**

pollen, honey/(very)light caramel, vanilla pods, woodsmoke (slight), cedar wood, copper, mineral/metallic, granite, stone fruits (plums, dried dates), stewed figs, crayon wax, flax/cereal grain, potpourri (slight) .

a very gentle and welcoming nose. unassuming, but very far from boring. it's subtly fruity in a very irish way, which for me means lots of pitted fruit. there is just a trace of wood smoke, but it doesn't really seem peaty at all. i'm really surprised at the excellent balance and integration on the nose. it's practically already worth the price!

**aroma water:**

apples (slight cider), vanilla, red plums, jammy figs, minerality, wood smoke (very slight), sweet charred wood, candle wax.

lot's a diverse flavors are still present with water, but things may be getting a little too subtle. it's a little frustrating to have to search for every aroma. the integrated scent overall is pleasing.

**taste neat:**

stewed apples, cinnamon (slight), soft oak, low tannins, light/sweet barrel char, vanilla, candle wax, tarry sap.

a little thin and light at 40%, but very palatable. this would be an excellent "introductory" whisky for new enthusiasts! the balance is laudable, like the nose. it's not at all "punchy," which unfortunate, because i like my whisky to have some vitality to it.

**taste water:**

stewed apples, wood smoke, creamy vanilla, light tea with honey, malt barley, wood pulp.

i only added a drop or two of water, since the palate neat was rather thin. naturally, it's still very thin here. the flavors did develop a bit, with smoke and wood becoming more prominent.

**finish:**

cinnamon, plum pits, tin/copper, mineralic, barrel char, vanilla, black tea.

great minerality and dimensionality. can't believe i only paid 20 usd for this!

**conclusion:**

easy nose that is complex, if you do some searching.

balanced palate that is best kept neat.

high quality, dimensional, medium duration finish. 

**rating:** 83/100

as it stands, this is a pretty good whisky and an excellent value. if trader joe's had bottled this at an unchillfiltered 46%, i think they'd have something excellent on their hands. still, i'd be happy to drink this neat or even use it in cocktails, given the low price.
