i am quite surprised that this is not in the archive yet. first!

**crown royal (80 proof)**

color: deep copper

nose: maple syrup, confectionery sugar, toffee, a little mint, cough syrup

taste: caramel and fruit snacks at the tip of the tongue, with some vanilla and anise mid-palate followed by some bitter wood tannin and grape tums in the back end; super thin mouth feel

finish: none, medicinal cough syrup lingers

overall: another "not bad, but not great whiskey." i reached a bit with the nose except for the cough syrup note. this whiskey's strength is in its taste, as thin as it is. very easy to drink. reminds me of jim beam white but not as good. probably great on ice or used as a mixer.

rating: fine (71/100)
