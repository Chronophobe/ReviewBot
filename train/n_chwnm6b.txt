not so much an inferiority complex. i don't feel i'm less of a person or have less of a palette because i like a different kind of whiskey. it's more like a persecution complex...is that a thing? 

i can't speak for him but for me i have been to tasting after tasting where they'll go the gamut and invariably, invariably there will be someone who, upon seeing me not convulsing into orgasmic ecstasy will utter phrases like

"you just don't appreciate the complexity of this one"

"this takes a lot of experience to truly appreciate how great it is"

"you have to understand that ardbeg is just better than other scotch and like most things in life that are better, most people can't appreciate it"

always something about how i must not appreciate how great it is. those are direct quotes, btw, i'm not paraphrasing these stories. i follow one of those types of comments  up, invariably, with something about how much i truly love whiskey and all of its vast differences whether it is bourbon or scotch, campbeltown or speyside, there really is a flavor for everyone. the more open minded ones will agree with me while the more egregious offenders will just look at me pityingly.
