**amrut fusion. 50% abv. tasted neat.**

finally got around to making this review!

**nose:** barley, mandarins, hint of mango,its got this condensed sweetness to it that i cant quite place but love. 

**taste:** rich. crystallized ginger, the chicken schnitzel that we are given (not kidding), the standard vanilla and oak. slight almonds.

**finish:** spicy sweet. you can tell its 50% abv. 

**conclusion:** there is nothing 'wrong' with this whisky, however there is nothing that particularly appeals to me within it. i would never turn an offering of this down, but in a situation with other options i would pass over this one. it's a shame as there has been a lot of hype surrounding the fusion, but just not for me. the nose was the best part for me.

**score: 79/100**
