i've actually been fortunate enough to have tried just about all that you have listed here.  the thing that is hard to find are barrels out of scotland.  makers and buffalo have very distinct flavors, similar to the elijah craig.  

i've found myself recently getting into beers aged in cab barrels as well, but i've always longed for a speyside or highland in an english style barleywine or very low ibu ale.  my absolute favorite beer is the double dba from firestone walker and if you like the ones on your list, i think you'll really enjoy it as well.
