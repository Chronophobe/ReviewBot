hola ww, texacer here with another quick review.  a man bought me a drink at a bar last night and it was **redbreast 15 year 92 proof**.  after the waitress failed and i had to return the redbreast 12 for the 15 that i asked for, here is what i found: 

* color:  fake amber gold
* nose: fruity light floral vanilla. not much. flour.  red licorice hints?
* taste: light strawberry and dominating generic vanilla, with peppery mint hints that would have been more interesting if it wasnt all distilled out i'm sure.  buttery butterscotch, slightly chewy.  
* finish: smooth and oily

i don't like irish.  i have tried.  supposedly middleton is good but that costs 11 toes.  the redbreast cask strength batch 1 was the one i like and now that batch 2 has sullied my love for rbcs, i'm at a loss for an irish to enjoy.  oh well.
