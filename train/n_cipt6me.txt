i only had a dram of it and i haven't opened the bottle yet, but from what i remember it had a really apparent winy character (at least to me it had). i don't remember if it had a port cask finish, but it sure tastes like it. a deep and rich fruitiness and a little spice.

keep in mind we were tasting a few different cardhu variations one after the other, so the taste might seem a bit out of balance. the deep, winy character was definitely only this one though, it's the reason i bought it.
