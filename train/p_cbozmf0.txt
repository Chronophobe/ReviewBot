**color:**  golden amber

**nose:** light, sweet, and oaky. apple cider, raisins, port, linen, butter, leather-wood honey, apricot, cream, citrus. a little bit harsh without water.

**palate:** light bodied and fresh. malty, pear, sour apple, cherry, honey. slight rubbing alcohol, otherwise very light.

**finish:** short but smooth. caramel, butter, white pepper, and slightly smoky on the end. not very warming and not a lot of character. a bit numbing without water.

**score:** 79/100

**comments:** the nose had promise but i didnâ€™t much enjoy the taste due to a lack of character. while it had some nice notes, it was very mild. it was okay, but could have used a little more depth on the palate and finish - the nose saved it. this would be a good, gentle whisky for a beginner's introduction. thanks to /u/uncletobys for the sample.
