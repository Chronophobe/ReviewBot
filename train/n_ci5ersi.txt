something a bit different, but figured i'd post it anyway.  all of my friends know i'm a bourbon guy...i've even kicked around the idea with a couple of them in the past about taking a trip out to the trail some time.  so when i was thinking how i'd ask my buddies to be a part of my wedding i figured i'd have a little fun with it.  

basically and found these cheap little wooden gift boxes for a couple bucks at walmart.  very cheaply done and rough all over so i bought some sandpaper and stain and went to town.  over christmas my fiancee and i had received a few boxes of smoked meats and cheeses that had the stuffing pieces in them so i saved them knowing i could use them at some point (bonus points because they still smelled like smoked meat).  fiancee found the cards on etsy--we all watched himym so it fit and it allowed me to write something to each of them since most of these had to be mailed.

of course the most difficult part was selecting which bourbon to send them.  actually who am i kidding it wasn't hard at all.  most all of them have probably grown tired of listening to me and my love affair with the buffalo trace distillery.  i absolutely love almost everything they produce and my favorite every day go-to bourbon is buffalo trace.  i had never seen the taster bottles before, but when i was up at a redditors liquor store awhile back i saw them and knew i had to buy them.  it was a tight fit, but the lid was just high enough to fit the bottles.

i was going to throw my review of bt in here as well, but realized the picture would be all messed up since it isn't the only thing and it wouldn't really follow with the format, so i'll save it for this weekend.  unfortunately the bourbon drinking has declined rapidly as i whip my butt back into shape for these engagement pictures so my usually weekend notebook review hasn't happened in months.
