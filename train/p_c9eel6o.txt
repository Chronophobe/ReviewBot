alright, i owe you an actual one.

*[kweichow moutai.](http://thirstyblogger.my/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/guizhoupic.jpg) [maotai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maotai) (chinese fermented sorghum spirit). bottled at 53% abv. local bottle price: $280 for 500ml.*

**nose:** lemon citrus. whiteboard marker, expensive soap, white rice. very sweet and floral and unusual.

**palate:** burning, still very sweet. soy sauce and vinegar. lychee sweetness trying to bring balance.

**finish:** driven by a bitter barley cereal note that is more reminiscent of an asian beer than anything related to whisky. more of the umami-sweet asian sauces that you feel like you should be dipping a spring roll into.

alright, it's not as bad as i thought, maybe if i grew up accustomed to a wide variety of chinese flavours, this would be more familiar and easy to enjoy. i didn't, so it isn't.

thanks for the unique experience.
