these are australian single malt whiskies from the old hobart distillery in tasmania. thanks to ayedfy for the sample of the sherry cask!

**overeem sherry cask matured cs, 60% abv**

* nose: vanilla essence and syrup. cinnamon, cocoa and nuts. stewed plums and cherries. pepper and oak. a little smokey.

* taste: warm, smooth and oily. cherries and sultanas with chocolate sauce. pomegranate juice. nectarines and candied orange peel. nutmeg, salt and pepper. 

* finish: robusta coffee with condensed milk. salted toffee with chilli flakes. medium, dryish and numbing.

very nice sherry bomb - straight forward, well made and enjoyable. this won't make you go "wow!" but it won't make you fall asleep either.

**overeem port cask matured cs, 60% abv**

* nose: brandy, dried figs and caramel. toasted chocolate croissants that have been lightly burnt. raspberry jam, grapes and currants. oak spice and tannins.

* taste: hot, spicy and viscous. tannic and dry. cranberry juice, grapefruit, sultanas and dried dates. tawny port and coffee beans. floral honey, black pepper and brine.

* finish: bitter dark chocolate covered liquorice. more brandy. bay leaves, pepper and cardamom. medium-long, dryish and numbing.

this one did make me go "wow!" but not enough to make this a 90+. great stuff but the sullivans cove port cs is a little bit better.

i'm really enjoying port matured aussie whiskies. tasmania is producing some world class single malts.
