here it is: the whisky that allegedly started the american craze for canadian whisky—hiram walker’s club whisky. of course, 140-some-odd years later, it’s probably a different beast than it once was, but this is still canadian club premium, the brand’s flagship. manufactured, since its inception, just a few miles from the house i grew up in (and boy did i love the smell of fermentation and distillation), and a constant presence in my parents’ liquor cabinet.

of course, they mixed it—with ginger ale or coke. probably a wise move, as i’ve discovered, by way of re-approaching this monster in a mini-bottle sample.

**canadian club premium**; no age statement (though at one time i recall it carrying a six-year age tag); this comes from a 50ml sample bottle, but a full 750ml bottle goes for about $27 cdn. in the province of alberta.

**appearance:** not a bad colour, pretty much dead-on amber—but i suspect there’s caramel colouring to thank for that. better legs than i would have expected. the bottle is a classic, i guess.

**nose:** astringent alcohol kick, but pretty closed otherwise. faint hay or grass. faint dusty rye. burnt plastic, but also something distinctly metallic. faint citrus (orange, lemon)? vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, but all surprisingly weakly for a canadian whisky (more vanilla after some time). vegetal? faint oak, maple syrup. really feels like they’re using some tired, tired casks. not good. but at least it’s fairly weak, rather than in-your-face awful. prickly enough, alcohol –wise, that i have to pull my nose out of the glass after a couple sniffs to keep my eyes from watering.

**taste:**  if i may quote homer simpson, “it passed the first test: i didn’t go blind.” better than the nose, but nothing to write home about. sweet, at first. mostly smooth, save for some raw alcohol notes around the edges. citrus (faint orange peel), vanilla, just a hit of rye spice. get a bit more flavour as you let it sit on your tongue—oak, maple—but also more astringency, more bitterness.

**finish:** smooth, but dry, weakly-oaked. heat. citrus. short. bitterness after some time. mercifully short.

**final thoughts:** nope, not doing that again. cc’s reputation took a hit in the us in the 1980s, when they added small amounts of american-produced neutral grain spirit to their whisky in order to benefit from tax breaks then being offered by the us government. they’ve thankfully stopped that practice, though i’m not sure it could have made this particular whisky any worse than it already is (okay, i guess that’s hyperbole). i suppose this stuff is innocuous, mostly smooth, and inexpensive. it’s got some history? i can see why someone who grew up with it might enjoy sipping it on ice, or in a cocktail. but it’s just not good. relentlessly average in every way i can think of.

**score:** 67

*(just as an addendum: i accidentally poured a bit into a glencairn that still had a small amount of mount gay extra old rum in it. i sipped it after realizing my mistake, and the end result was actually pretty palatable. so there’s that. . . .)*
