    there once was a dram named redbreast
    jim murray proclaimed it the best*
      from a single pot still
      i drank it until
    i had to lie down for a rest

my first real experience with whisk(e)y was an irish (bushmills black bush), but for no good reason, it has taken me this long to find my way back to the island of my heritage. uncletobys was looking at this and a few of us decided to throw down for a bottle split. 

*redbreast 15. single pot still irish whiskey, distilled at the new midleton distillery and aged for 15 years in a combination of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. bottled at 46% abv. local bottle price: $123 for 700ml.*

**nose:** sherry influence coming through quite strong, with overripe plums, spicy dried apricots, and sweet, malty vanilla. the 15 years of aging has imparted a very dry oaky element that balances quite nicely with the sweetness.

**palate:** medium-bodied with a wonderful velvety texture. rich honey, peach syrup, cranberries, and a continuation of malty vanilla tying it all together. the high alcohol isn't producing much alcohol bite, serving instead to give more life to the flavour profile.

**finish:** plums, red grapes and passionfruit leading a very sweet, fruity finish. touches of cereals found in american whiskies, such as corn and rye. medium length, soft and smooth.

noticeably different to the whiskies i'm used to (single malts, as well as american bourbons/ryes). very approachable and drinkable, with enough complexity to keep your attention. i would definitely consider buying a full bottle of this. 

**91/100**
