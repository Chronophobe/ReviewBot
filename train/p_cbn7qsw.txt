g'day whiskay woorld, texasuh here wit annutha quiack review.  ok enough of that.  uncle "wallaby" tobys was kind enough to trade me some great sample from down unda.  first of which that i've gotten around to is **heartwood convict release 116 proof**.

* color: amber
* nose: woody.  strong tight light fragrant clean sweet soap. nutmeg.  dark dried berries. vanilla and rum. 
* taste: creamy black licorice.  malty woody caramelized butter/sugar.  black tea. sweet nutmeg and hints of cinnamon.  dark wine. 
* finish: the anise pops out, warm

very good.  tasmanian.  a great creamy bitterness to it.  looks like it was matured in port casks?  love me some port matured whisky.  here is their [website](http://www.heartwoodmaltwhisky.com.au/).  check out their poem.  convict release?  i know very little about this whisky area of the world and feel fortunate to have tried this guy.  not to be confused with **[this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irrokz5rjxc)**.  

&gt; 91/100
