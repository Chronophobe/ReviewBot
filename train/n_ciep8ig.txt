i have to agree with that. india is a freaking oven. the tropical south is a steam bath. the only parts of that country that ever cool off are up in the mountains, places like himachal pradesh or sikkim.

still, the heat issue has nothing at all to do with quality whisk(e)y. if someone is going to make the claim they can't do a good and proper job because the weather is too beastly, that's an argument for not trying.

if people really want to take issue with my putting the word in quotes, then they are giving a pass to the oceans of indian "whisky" that is 80 or 90% vodka or rum. if that is really what people want to do, then they should get some and drink it. period.
