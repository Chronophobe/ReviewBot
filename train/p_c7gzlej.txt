*type:* pure pot still whiskey -
*abv:* 51%


* **colour:** pale gold

* **nose:** clean with malt, vanilla, apples and pears, caramel, oak, raisin and buttered toast with apricot marmalade. some fruity - and (lemon) grassy tones as well. agreeable but not overly exciting.
 
* **taste:** quite nice but not very complex. it reminded me a bit of a banana-liqueur. i also find lots of malt and vanilla (custard), spices (white pepper and cinnamon), caramel and a tad of honey.
 
* **finish:** middle long with vanilla, lemon, pepper, oak and a hint of cocoa powder. quite dry in the end.

i added a few drops of water and i can't find any material changes. the dram softens up even more and i did get some mint on the palate as well. i think you should should try this tyrconnell both ways to find out what suites you best.

**rating:** 83.5 

nose:  21 - taste:  21.5 - finish: 20  - overall: 21

**general remarks:** tyrconnell of course is a brand of the cooley distillery. tyrconnell is the name of an irish race horse that won the irish derby in 1876 at 100-1 odds. the distillery was founded in 1820 by alexander stuart but closed in 1925. the brand name was bought and reintroduced by the cooley distillery in 1988.
this specific batch was distilled on november 5, 1992 and bottled on august 26, 2009. 

**drinking experience neat:** good

**conclusion:** this is a step up from the tyrconnell single malt. however it's also quite expensive at around us$ 100,- a bottle. the ambassador' s choice is a well-crafted whiskey but it's not complex enough to justify its high price in my opinion.
