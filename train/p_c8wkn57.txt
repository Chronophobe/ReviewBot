thanks to 12side for sending me a mystery dram in our latest swap. i enjoy doing these, as they help me learn. let me start by saying i want to like this more than i do. the nose is actually quite beautiful on this one, containing all you would want in a dessert. so without further ado:

**mystery whisky abv guess: 40-43%**

* **color:** golden amber
* **nose:** caramel, maple syrup, icing, brown sugar, vanilla and sees candy toffee
* **palate:** overpowering in the sweetness, strong maple syrup and brown sugar, light creamy caramel, hint of oak coming through and maybe some pine needles.
* **finish:** medium long, sweetness continues heavily with slightly more wood coming through now.
* **rating: 70/100**

this has got to be a bourbon with the characteristics it has. i liked what the nose had to offer and would gladly continue smelling it as long as someone else drinks it. it's not i would turn it down bad but i definitely wouldn't purchase a bottle. i don't know enough about bourbon to venture a guess at the distiller, it is definitely low alcohol content in the 40-43% range.
