really? honestly? ok. i'll draft one up. what i can tell you right now, is drinking the two gives me a clear indication of the difference between bourbon and whiskey. there is no mucking about the stereotyped definitions here. this 5 years canadian "whiskey" is way more alcoholically with a bite. while the 3 years american "bourbon" was sweet as syrup.
