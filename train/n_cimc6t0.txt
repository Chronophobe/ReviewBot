a bottle review, not the bourbon. the bourbon was fantastic however.

this bottle is great. it's narrow profile allows a sure grip, a perfect hand fit. but as though that isn't enough, the face is tapered just far enough in to fit your thumb and fingers.

the mouth on the bottle is wider than most bottles. this allows air to back flow assuring a smooth pour. but the best feature of all is the lip on the bottle. it is extended out. this lip sets down inside the glass preventing any drips or spills. it's a fantastic design. why isn't every bottle designed this way.

this may be a new favorite if only for the bottle. i'm glad it's a good whiskey too.
