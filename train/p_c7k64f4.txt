hello ww, texacer here with another quick review.  i was sent 10 samples of canadian whiskey by another ww member.  very kind.  i wanted to give canada a try since my experience with them has been very small but not very positive.  the selection on our shelves here is light he sent me some that i can't find.  up first: **canadian club sherry cask 80 proof**, which i have seen locally but my friend convinced me against bothering with it.  here goes


* color: glossy amber
* nose: wood sweet.  vanilla.  grassy.  tortilla. 
* taste: candy sherry.  caramel.  pine.  light.
* finish: mild

step up from classic but very simple. too light. i get the sherry note but its overly sweet, hence the candy note.  still glad to try it so now i know what its all about.  not terrible but too light for me.  

&gt;70/100
