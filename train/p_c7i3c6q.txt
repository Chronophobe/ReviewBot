white owl whisky, made by century distillers (or highwood distillers, as their name seems to change depending on which of their products you buy) in alberta, canada, is the self-proclaimed “original white whisky”—a title that actually doesn’t make much sense for a number of reasons (amongst them that white whisky has been a phenomenon for a very long time, especially in the us).

but century says that this stuff is different from those other white whiskies in one important respect—unlike most new-make spirit that gets sold under the label of “white whisky,” white owl has been aged (for at least three years, i’ve heard, though there’s no official figure from the company—davin at www.canadianwhisky.org says there are whiskies as old as 10 years in here, but if that’s the case, what a waste of warehouse stock). but yes, it is clear. clear as vodka, or sprite or 7-up, or whatever metric for clearness you wish to use. 

how the company pulls that off is, they say, a secret, but the story goes that it took a lot of experimentation to get it to work. because, you see, when they filtered different batches to make them clear, they also filtered out all the flavour (gee, go figure). it was finally a special mix of grains the company developed that retained some flavour even after filtering (allegedly a high wheat content did the trick, but that smacks of marketing b.s. because *most* of highwood’s whiskies are known for the unusual addition of wheat to the mash-bill).

here’s the thing. this stuff is bad. it’s not good. it’s not just that it’s a gimmick. i could forgive a gimmick if the resulting whisky was good. the bottle is cool, and the whisky isn’t utter poison, but that’s about the best i can say here. bland, uninteresting, unappealing.

white owl whisky; no age statement; 750ml; goes for $40 cdn. in both ontario and alberta, putting it toward the high-end of mainstream canadian whiskies (and more expensive than the two best canadian whiskies i’ve tried this year)

**appearance:** yup, it’s clear. neat. whatever. i guess at least there’s no caramel colouring added?

**nose:** i don’t know if it’s just the appearance, but there is a distinct weird sprite-like citrus soda vibe, here, combined with some grain, and your standard canadian whisky vanilla-butterscotch. oddly not entirely unlike century reserve 21 year old (suggesting a distinct house style for the distillery), but lacking any sense of integration or appeal, and with a faint but distinctly unpleasant alcohol prickle throughout. paint thinner. mostly bland, but sharp enough to give me sort of a weird headache. i guess it’s not entirely without a redeeming quality, but it’s not especially likeable, either. the alcohol/paint-thinner kick seems to grow after a few minutes, then recedes. water doesn’t do much of anything.

**taste:** somehow both watery and alcoholic. grainy. fiery (or maybe fiery isn’t the best word—it doesn’t sear your mouth, it’s just sort of a constant, light-and-yet-entirely unenjoyable prickle). unpleasant. a watery chemical sort-of vanilla/butterscotch synthesis. but again, bland. if the nose isn’t completely unpleasant, the taste certainly is a lot less enjoyable. which is to say not at all enjoyable. vanilla ice cream? tremendously uninteresting, generally, and a little fiery. this stuff might as *well* be vodka, if we’re being honest. water just . . . well, waters it down. still tastes chemically and artificial.

**finish:** vanilla, faint oak. short, not really exciting.

**final thoughts:** the first time i tried this stuff, i legitimately thought it was just brilliantly marketed new-make spirit—then it occurred to me that it would be illegal to sell it in canada if that were the case—whisky here needs to be in the barrels for at least three years before you’re allowed to call it whisky. a second taste now, a year or two later reveals that the situation isn’t quite *that* dire, but this stuff is still not very good at all. seems like a waste to take legitimately aged whiskies and essentially filter out the flavours that make them interesting. it’s not that this is too young, or too fiery, or just so dreadful (i’ve certainly put worse whiskies in my mouth)—it’s just that it’s essentially lacking anything to make it remotely compelling beyond a silly gimmick. not entirely outright offensive, but bland, uninteresting, silly, and too pricey. i guess you could mix this, but . . . why bother?

**final score:** 69/100
