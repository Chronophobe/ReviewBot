before we begin, a little background on this whisky. there were two releases: one cask strength, and one diluted. this one is 58%. and it's the diluted one.

*heartwood convict release. tasmanian single malt, distilled may 2001 by bill lark at the tasmania distillery. matured for 11 years in a port cask and bottled in december 2012 by tim duckett at 58% abv. paid $200 for 700ml.*

**nose:** rich dark fruits. juicy cherries, plums, even some strawberry. incredibly malty, fascinating dessert notes of vanilla cheesecake and christmas pudding, and a subtle grassy/hay character.

**palate:** incredibly full bodied, very winey. surprisingly smooth texture despite the high abv. port wine influence is definitely announced, and again, the flavours are still strongly malty. dark red grapes, maple syrup, sultanas, and more creamy vanilla.

**finish:** did i mention malty yet? quite spicy on this finish as well actually, not unlike a good rye. cinnamon, warm raisin toast, and more lovely port wine. respectfully long and satisfying.

an exemplary port-matured single malt; enough wine cask influence to add new dimensions of flavour, while still retaining enough of the original character of the whisky. this is getting it right! confirming my suspicions that tim duckett's heartwood label is a tasmanian ib that is actually worth your time and money.

**95/100**

*also, if you've a palate for fire, you might want to check out the cask-strength bigger brother to this (titled the 'convict unchained'), which is bottled a little stronger at 71.9% abv.*
