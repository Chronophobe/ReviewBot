from the [website:]( http://nantdistillery.com.au/)

&gt; nant whisky is handcrafted exclusively on the nant estate as a premium single malt whisky using traditional pot still distillation methods, tasmanian barley and water sourced from the surrounding highland lakes.

&gt;each individual cask is matured, decanted and hand bottled on the estate as a single cask maturation.
maturation takes place in traditional american and french oak casks, which have previously held port, sherry or bourbon. it is from these casks that nant whisky takes on its individual characteristics. from the spicy christmas cake characteristics in the port cask to the creamy and oily vanillas of the american oak cask each cask is its own individual expression. we welcome you to try our three single malt whisky expressions, french oak port, french oak sherry and american oak bourbon.

&gt;in the age old tradition, our casks are stored on the estate in convict built sandstone buildings that have stood for over 180 years, and left to mature in an environment of quietude and tranquility.

&gt;the result is a unique tasmanian highland single malt whisky that captures the essence of tasmania from which it has been created.

* nose: perfume and cedar. barley sugar, grape skin and figs. fresh bay leaves. dried dates. burnt nuts, cinnamon and cocoa. sweet black tea with milk. faint horseradish in the background.

* taste: light-medium bodied. very delicate on the palate. floral honey, light oak spice and creamy malt. a bit grassy. brown sugar and dried berries. marmalade, ginger and ripe apples. sweet, zesty and fresh.

* finish: honey roasted nuts. a touch of eucalyptus and basil. more horseradish. salty towards the end. medium and pleasant.

interesting and complex nose. taste and finish are very good but could be better.

i will be visiting the distillery next month and i can't wait to try their cask strength offerings!
