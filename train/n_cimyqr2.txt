you know, i had high hopes when i saw the bottle being brought out as macallan rarely disappoints.  however, i did not find it very enjoyable and would rather drink the macallan fine oak 10yr in any instance.  

the whisky did not finish well and i was not impressed.

btw, the bottle does look huge doesn't it? i thought the same after i took the photo.
