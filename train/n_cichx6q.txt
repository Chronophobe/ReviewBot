i agree with you mostly. however, my biggest thing is this cuts into supply. when supply goes down prices go up, which we have really seen the last 2-3 years. example : i have watched bunnahabhain go from $42 to over $60. the distilleries will continue to make good stuff for us, but we will pay more.
