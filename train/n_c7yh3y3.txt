i'd like to get a few recomendations on some alternatives to this whisky.
it's not available in my area any more and i really enjoyed it.

looking for something that would be described as light, sweet, vanilla, honey, etc.
nectar d'or was $90 here.  if possible i'd like to find something around the $50-$60 range.
