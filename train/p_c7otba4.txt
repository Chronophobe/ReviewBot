just about every post on this subreddit is desperately asking: which is better? crown royal maple or actual maple syrup? well this morning, over some homemade waffles, i determined to find out.

**nh grade a dark maple syrup**

to be fair, using a light maple syrup would have been a more appropriate for this test, but in fear of not being able to "taste" it properly, i decided not to travel across three states to get some light syrup, and instead kept with the dark syrup i had previously. sadly, real maple syrup has a terrible nose. weak at best, and disgusting at worse. thankfully, the flavor we all know and love really shined through the palate and finish.

*color: solid amber*

*nose: (weak) cardboard, honey, maple wood, kneadable erasers, graham crackers*

*mouth: smooth, buttery, syrupy*

*palate: butter, dark maple syrup, caramel*

*finish: (long) maple candy, butter*

**rating: n/a**

**crown royal maple finished**

i had shot this "whisky" before, and cut it with actual syrup for some pancakes. it is actually fairly good at turning maple syrup slightly alcoholic without totally ruining the flavor. this is surprisingly consistent, and not a whole lot to hate about it, but absolutely nothing to like about it either.

*color: clear brass*

*nose: scented nail polish, maple syrup, basil, candle wax, honey, corn syrup*

*mouth: oily and watery*

*palate: leather, smoked maple, linseed oil*

*finish: (short) maple syrup*

**rating: 1 monocle | 40%**

**battle royal (pun intended)**

**color:** *maple syrup is too thick to appear as authentic whisky* 

*winner: crown royal*

**nose:** *maple syrup is very weak on the nose, and is quite terrible in some places. the crown royal, once you get past the ethanol, is not actually bad at all (if what you want is maple syrup that is)* 

*winner: crown royal*

**mouth:** *taking a shot of maple syrup was disgusting* 

*winner: crown royal*

**palate:** *crown royal was only a slight reminder that maple syrup existed, where the actual maple syrup was, as expected, delicious* 

*winner: maple syrup*

**finish:** *crown royal has almost no finish, especially compared to the lovely long and buttery finish of real maple syrup* 

*winner: maple syrup*

**winner: maple syrup**

sorry, crown royal, your maple finished whisky is terrible. you got the nose right, i'll give you that, and it is an actual whisky, unlike maple syrup, so you have that going, but the palate and non existent finish is just too terrible and disappointing to give you anything but a participation trophy, which you should probably light on fire.
