alright ww, texacer here with his last canadian review for a while.  this is the best one that i've tried so i waited until last:  **alberta premium dark horse 90 proof**


* color: syrupy orange
* nose: minted licorice.  woody pine. 
* taste:  rich anise.  buttery rye mint.  fresh rolls (bread).  tootsie rolls. 
* finish: spicy medium

like i said, the best one of the ten i reviewed but it just can't make it into the 90s.  i'm not being biased or anything but canadian whisky just doesnt do it for me like scotch or bourbon.  the quality, balance, complexity i look for in whisky is just not there.  irish isn't my stuff either except for redbreast.  (i do have a tullemore dew on deck though).  this alberta premium dark horse is as good as it gets for me from my northern neighbors.  it was good to try them but canada really needs to start trying harder and pushing the limits.  maybe try some more aging, less maple, higher abvs and experiment with different grains more.  

&gt;89/100
