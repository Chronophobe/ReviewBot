&gt; we were fortunate that iain henderson a distiller of some note from laphroaig, although ready to retire, was talked into coming along to help get us going. in december 2006 we were able to make the first 29 barrels of english whisky and by august 2007 we opened to the public with a visitor centre, fantastic whisky shop and tours. iain has now retired again, but before he did, he spent 4 months training david fitt, a brewer from greene king to take over. david is now distillery manager and is also responsible for making a superb whisky spirit.

&gt;since the original distillations back in 2006, we have made nearly 2000 casks which are all maturing nicely in our warehouses. the distillery creates both unpeated and peated whisky, as well as having a rolling program of cask trials. the cask trials have resulted in some wonderful whiskies as can be seen in chapter 7 &amp; 10. ongoing maturation will continue to result in new releases over the coming years. we hope you enjoy them.

**english whisky co. chapter 6, 46% abv (copypasta from previous review)**

*3 year old unpeated english single malt whisky*

* nose: sweet cereal and malt. candle wax/smoke. fresh multigrain bread with honey. vanilla sponge cake with a bit of spice. faint leathery notes and some sandalwood.

* taste: warm and viscous initially, but quickly becomes hot and tangy. grapefruit skin/juice and cayenne pepper. dry oak, fresh ginger and green apples. honey cheerios.

* finish: a little harsh, but not unpleasant. burnt nuts and salted toffee. more pepper, cinnamon and aniseed. medium, slightly bitter and dry.

i'm very surprised by this 3yo english whisky. sure, it lacks refinement and balance, but it's quite tasty! if you like zesty drams with spice, citrus and cereal/malt, you should give this a try. 

&gt;**82/100**

*3 year old peated english single malt whisky*

* nose: sweet crisp barley and peat smoke. fresh citrus and vanilla. apple and custard tart. floral honey, hickory and sandalwood. faint caramelised banana.

* taste: tangy and fruity. slight floral peatiness. peppery and spicy. honey dew melon and icing sugar. briny and earthy towards the end.

* finish: resinous pine and sweet tobacco smoke. earthy peat. anise, cayenne pepper and cardamom. medium and dry.

nice young peated whisky. a few more years and this could rival 10yo islays.

*3 year old sherry finished english single malt whisky*

* nose: dried figs, dates and sultanas. freshly struck matches. leather and oak. salted toffee, cinnamon and pepper. walnuts.

* taste: tingly mouthfeel. sherbet, tart oranges and apple cider. juicy grapes and berries. dry sherry. oak spice and tannins.
