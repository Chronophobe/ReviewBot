i just realized i have no idea the answer to this question. i guess as long as it takes less time to make peat than it takes to age scotch supply would match demand. 

is there aged peat? do they use peat that's been in a bog for 100 years to make a really special scotch? omg this whole conversation is starting to make me think too much about scotch
