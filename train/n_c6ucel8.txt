this is part of what i'm researching. the tasmanian distillers might actually be going their own way, or at least banding together for appellation laws and commercial ventures. so i'm trying to see if tasmania might be a better 'regional brand' for whisky than 'australia' (which has connotations with desert, i.e. not a nice place to make whisky).

might sound strange, but i'm looking more at the distinct regional branding/place image rather than the taste of the drinks.
