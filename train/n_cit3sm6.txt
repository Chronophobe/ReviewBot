that's a pretty good idea! thanks, kyle. 

sku is really good about posting interesting stuff on twitter and i am on twitter everyday so i'm happy to let him filter them plus his insight is very valuable.

btw - are you guys going to do another cask strength release this fall? it's been pretty silent on your front.
