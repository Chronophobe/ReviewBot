**virginia highland malt whisky, 46% abv**

thanks to mattofmattfame for the sample!

from the [website]( http://www.vadistillery.com/home.html):

&gt;we started by acquiring an aged, vatted highland malt from scotland, already complex and luscious with acacia honey and ginger notes. to enhance its quality and to give it the taste of our commonwealth, we then finished it in french oak wine barrels used to age virginia port-style wine at a vineyard a few miles from our distillery.

* nose: honey, nuts and cocoa. leather and oak spice. clean malty notes. dried dates and berries. liquorice, potpourri and vanilla custard. faint disinfectant in the background. 

* taste: medium bodied, warm and rich. cranberry juice, black grapes and burnt cereal. marmalade, fresh mint and oak. spicy tobacco leaves.

* finish: tannic, herbal and earthy. medium and slightly bitter.

nice dram, nothing mind blowing  but enjoyable.
