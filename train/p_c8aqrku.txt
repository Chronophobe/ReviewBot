single malt. japan. 43% abv.

* **color:** light gold.
* **nose:** malty. vanilla. citrus. mint. dill.
* **palate:** earthy. savory. you can see the beginnings of the 18 but it's not quite there yet. 
* **finish:** medium length. honeyed sweetness with some spice and raisins. slightest hint of aspartame. 

score: **82/100**

another sample from my mom dram club that i've already had but never reviewed. this is probably the most widely available japanese whisky in the us. it's quite refreshing and could have easily been made in the highlands of scotland. it doesn't hold a candle to the 18, but it's good in its own right.
