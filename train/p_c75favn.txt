**george t. stagg 15 year 2012 release from buffalo trace distillery**

* color: deep mahogany, almost like sweet tea

* nose: sweet, vanilla, brown sugar, maple. smells very mellow. 2-3 drops of water bring out a fruity aroma with hints of oak. added a few drops of water about 3 or 4 times and the nose completely changes every time. seen a slight change in other whiskeys but never like this.

* taste: extremely mellow on the front of the tongue, instantly taste brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and honey. hits the back of my tongue and holy s%@t!! taste and smooth warmth instantly fill my mouth and down my throat. it's almost 143 proof, but couldn't tell until now. it's not a sharp warmth, very smooth but fills your entire mouth. surprisingly none of the flavors are lost in the high alcohol content, they linger on the palate with the warmth. added 2 drops of water, let it breathe a few minutes, and the change in flavor is incredible. now there's hints of orange peel, caramel candy, pecans and chocolate. add a few more drops and it changes again, more oak, spices, dried fruit, slight strawberry and banana finish.

* finish: smoky, spicy, oaky with hint of peppermint. lingering warmth is very relaxing.

* overall: this is an incredible whiskey. it's truly amazing how different it becomes with a few drops of water, like the flavors are fighting one another to be tasted. each sip seems to cycle new flavors up front while the oak finish is like you're drinking right from the barrel with a subtle flavor or two rounding out each sip. i found it very hard to review this whiskey, it really has to be experienced to appreciate. it has won [numerous awards](http://www.buffalotracedistillery.com/) including world whiskey of the year 3 times. sorry this review is so long, but this probably the most amazing whiskey i've ever had. it's part of the buffalo trace antique collection that's released once a year (i'll eventually post reviews for all 5 in the 2012 release) so it can be hard to find but if you do, i highly recommend it.

97/100
