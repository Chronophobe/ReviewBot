hello world whiskey, i_637261636b_bits here, with my first non-scotch review. i always thought that a japanese or irish whiskey would be my first, but this past weekend i was in cardiff, wales with the family and looked up any local distilleries. to my surprise, the area only had a single distillery, penderyn (pronounced *pen-derrin*), which was a relatively young one at that, having only been formed in 1998, and first producing a real whisky in 2004. during our tour, one thing i found very interesting was that the distillery buys pre-fermented malted barley from a nearby brewery, and utilizes water from a well next to the distillery. very different from my understanding of scotch distilleries. not sure how much of an impact this has on the flavor of the whisky, but it definitely is a different whisky than what i’m used to. at the end of the tour, mia, our extremely friendly and wonderful hostess, gave me a bit extra, letting me sample four of the distillery’s whisky offerings: [the  madeira]( http://www.welsh-whisky.co.uk/our-whiskies/madeira-single-malt.aspx), [the peated]( http://www.welsh-whisky.co.uk/our-whiskies/penderyn-peated.aspx), [the sherrywood]( http://www.welsh-whisky.co.uk/our-whiskies/penderyn-sherrywood.aspx), and [the portwood]( https://www.penderynstore.com/penderyn-single-malt-whisky-portwood--41.aspx). after much consideration, i purchased a bottle of the portwood. the other whiskies were remarkably smooth, but lacked definition and strength in flavor, perhaps a testament to their smoothness. the portwood surprised me in its sweetness and the offering of daily enjoyment. not my favorite by far, but an enjoyable dram nonetheless.  
  
* color: reddish honey  
* nose: very woody. after some time, i found the blackberries that the bottle mentioned. a hint of pepper at the end intrigued me.  
* taste: first tastes are sweet, but also bitter, as if there was a very dark chocolate at play here that balances out the berry sweetness. the pepper from nosing returns here, reminding me of a talisker 10 year. trails of vanilla and even citrus nip at the tip of my tongue as the glass empties.  
* finish: spicy, with a delicate sweetness that strengthens before yielding to a dry oak sense. the pepperiness from before returns, making me reevaluate my description, as it evolves into a sweet chili strength.  
  
all things considered, i enjoyed this glass. as for the rest of the bottle? it will likely be my only welsh whisky purchase, unless i find myself at the distillery again. the flavors are intriguing, but i would like to see how this offering evolves over time. it is a pity that there aren’t other welsh whisky offerings to compare this too, considering the vast differences in settings between wales and scotland.
