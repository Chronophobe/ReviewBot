amrut single malt whisky - 46%

**nose:** dusty, hay and vanilla. plenty of malt and some light fruitiness.

**taste:** lots of vanilla and oak. quite creamy with spices. bitterness in the background.

**finish:** short but very warming. tart pears and a slight metallic tang.

**score:** 83/100

**conclusion:** a solid malt but it's leagues behind the amrut fusion. i'd like to to see how it compares to the cask strength and peated versions, but i've yet to find decently priced bottles or bars offering them.
