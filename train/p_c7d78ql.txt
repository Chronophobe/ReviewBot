**hibiki 17 blended japanese whisky, 43% abv**

hibiki is a blended whisky produced by suntory in japan, which means that the malt components are yamazaki and hakushu, and there will also be grain from the chita grain distillery. the hibiki 12 is very smooth and unique, partly due to the use of plum-wine casks in the blend. let's see how the 17 does!

**nose:** wonderfully fragrant, plum wine, a yamazaki-like oakiness, orange peel and orange oil. some toasted almonds, barley and grain sugar.

after water: toasted oak, almond nuttiness, fragrant fruitiness, rose water and orange blossom.

**palate:** sweet candied fruit peel, oily nuttiness and oak resin. a slightest hint of cereal and smoke. dry tannic oak later on.

after water: beautiful balance of oak, fruit and spice. very refined. floral sweetness and some plummy oaky spice. slightest hint of smoke. 

**finish:** smooth, soft and dry oaky spice. a hint of plum wine. dark chocolate and dates. very long. 

**overall:** this is a great japanese blend. it showcases the attention to detail and quality that the japanese put into their creation.  very complex and layered, with a very fragrant nose.

this was a bit of a disappointment initially, but after a few weeks opened it really became sublime. a drop or two of water also helps to open up the fragrant nose. 

**i give it an a/b - a if price is no object, pick it up for sure! b otherwise (try it in a bar but maybe not worth it for a bottle) as i don't think it's quite worth the price.**
