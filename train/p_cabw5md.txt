**pike creek double barreled, 40% abv**

sample courtesy of studiorat.

* nose: sweet caramel and pine. raw almonds. red grapes and ripe plums. vanilla essence. soft spice and cereal notes. spearmint candy. faintly floral.

* taste: light bodied and silky smooth. sweet and fruity. more caramel from the nose, but savoury rather than sweet. menthol and pine. some spiciness going into the finish.

* finish: woody, floral and bittersweet. grainy ethanol. short and simple.

great nose. passable taste. disappointing finish. 

not bad.
