**yamazaki 12, 43% abv**

* nose: lots of honey and sweet malt. poached pears and apples with vanilla cream. shortbread, cinnamon and icing sugar. flower pollen.

* taste: warm, smooth and lightly viscous. creme brulee and more honey. salt, white pepper and lime juice. some oaky bitterness.

* finish: sweet liquorice, orange peel and dry spice. barley sugar and under-ripe berries. medium long and dry.

a very well made, albeit boring dram. widely available, but consistently unexceptional. 

if you want an easy-drinking world whisky, this is the one you're looking for.
