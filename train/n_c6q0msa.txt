so this isn't an official review since i had it a bar and didn't take notes. i did find this whisky to be quite interesting and thought i would share some thoughts and info. i got notes of spices it was well balanced not too sweet like i find some bourbon to be, i can't quite describe but it was a unique taste. i think i might even prefer this to the jim beam black 8yr. check out the link the sweating process of extracting the "devil's cut" is pretty interesting.
