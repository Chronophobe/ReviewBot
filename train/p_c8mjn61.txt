**nikka miyagikyo 10, 45% abv, 50ml sample**

*japanese single malt whisky*

* nose: sweet and malty. vanilla cream, butterscotch and freshly cut flowers. ripe berries, pineapples and nectarines. fluffy pancakes with caramelized banana and golden syrup.  a bit flinty with some citrus and oak spice.

* taste: warm and mouth coating. medium bodied and smooth. honey, sweet cereal and barley. dried mandarin peel, green peppercorns and sour apples. floral and herbal. charred oak and spice.

* finish: oaky dryness and a bit ashy. fivespice, brown sugar, fresh mint  and burnt toast. medium, slightly bitter and tannic.

the nose on this is very nice and quite complex. the taste and finish delivered for the most part, but not as much as i hoped. 

like all of the japanese malts i've tried, this is very well made and easy to drink. i like this one slightly better than the yamazaki 12 so it gets one extra point.
