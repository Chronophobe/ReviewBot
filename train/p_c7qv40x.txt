**amrut fusion, 50% abv**

made with barley sourced from the feet of the himalayas and peated barley from scotland.

* nose: old honey, cinnamon, ripe tropical fruits (rambutan and lychee.) sweet and creamy with faint peat smoke.

* taste: tingly mouthfeel. sweet, yet savoury. ripe bananas, more honey and buttery shortbread. dry oak and wood spice.

* finish: aniseed, cocoa, white pepper. slightly herbal and vegetal. dry and almost numbing. medium to long and slightly bitter, like dark chocolate.

this stuff is pretty awesome; i can see how it won a bunch of awards. the fusion of barley from two different parts of the world may sound gimmicky but it *just clicks.* this is a great world whisky and it rivals some of scotland's finest.

**amrut peated cask strength, 62.8% abv**

*limited edition, bottled in february 2009, bottle #1824 of 3000*

* nose: peat and bbq smoke. meaty, sweet and delicious. vanilla, coriander seeds and clove. buttered cinnamon banana bread. honey and flower pollen.

* taste: oily and viscous. hot, yet creamy and smooth. rich chocolate and coffee. ripe tropical fruits. caramelised bananas with thick syrup.

* finish: herbs, black pepper and aniseed. charred oak and hot peppers. spiced honey and salted nuts. peaty, long and amazing.

i love this whisky. the peat notes are very different to islay peat - it is sweeter and more *tropical*, rather than briny, earthy and medicinal. it may lack refinement but it's incredibly rich, complex and robust. this dram is best savoured with small sips - the flavours are very strong.

i don't have much left and tried to order another bottle but it's sold out :'(
