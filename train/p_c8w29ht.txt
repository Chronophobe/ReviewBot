**hellyers road pinot finished, 46.2% abv**

*tasmanian single malt finished in pinot noir casks*

thanks to winnacht for the (almost) full bottle swap!

* nose: oak. horseradish and rhubarb. tea tree oil. sour citrus and grapes. bitter grapefruit and mangosteen. sweet cereal and malt. gummi bears and cola. olive brine. light floral smokiness. a bit waxy and soapy. chalky and flinty. crazy!

* taste: warm and dry. tart and spicy. pepper and hot chilli. crisp malt and cereal. preserved lemon and dried mandarin peel. grape skin and more bitter grapefruit. doughy and yeasty. dry oak, tannins and spice. faint rubber.

* finish: spicy tobacco, anise and cardamom. salty, nutty and woody. earthy mustiness. slightly vegetal. medium-long and very dry.

this is one of the strangest whiskies i've ever tried. crazy weird nose. a lot of wood and incredibly dry. savoury and astringent. zero balance but quite complex. 

it's not for everyone though. i like it.
