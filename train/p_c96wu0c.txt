**nikka taketsuru 17, 43% abv**

*japanese blended/vatted malt whisky*

thanks to hello_nasty for the sample!

* nose: sweet honeyed malt with a touch of vanilla. wood smoke and faint oak spice. pineapple. lemon and cherries. cereal and minerals. dried mango, jackfruit, banana and more pineapple.

* taste: a bit thin on the palate. crisp malt and cereal. honey lemon cough drops. white pepper and fresh mint. lightly toasted oak.

* finish: lemon rind. floral honey. a bit herbal. medium, dryish and slightly bitter.

great summer dram with a fantastic nose! if the  taste and finish were a bit better this would easily be a 90+. it sort of tastes like a blavenie x ancnoc.

not the most complex whisky but if you like honey, lemon and malt, you'd love this.

&gt;**88/100**

*a blend of grain whisky from miyagikyo and malt whisky from yoichi*

* nose: crisp cereal notes and wood smoke.  honeyed malt. desiccated coconut and dried pineapple. a bit flinty and metallic. marmalade and marzipan. white pepper and flower pollen.
