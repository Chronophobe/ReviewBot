crown royal reserve used to be known as crown royal special reserve (it’s the same recipe, according to the company); amusingly, even several years after the name change, the reserve bottle caps *still* [say the old name of the whisky](http://i.imgur.com/hiy02al.jpg) (they must have had quite a supply of those crown screw top caps). it’s also got to be one of *the* most divisive whiskies currently in the reddit whisky database—only four reviews, and scores ranging from the high 30s to the low 90s. curious. maybe we can shed some light on that.

**crown royal reserve canadian whisky**; no age statement (but made from “less than 1% of the crown royal supply,” with the very best barrels being set aside for additional aging); 40% abv; 750ml; retails for about $48 cdn. in the province of alberta.

**appearance:** unless it’s from a micro-distillery or explicitly says so, you can pretty well always assume e150a with canadian whisky, and this is no exception. fairly thin body. *love* the bottle, though (it’s leaps and bounds above the standard crown and the limited edition, just aesthetically speaking). if there’s one thing crown does well, it’s the branding.

**nose:** initially, i get that sort of bourbon-lite™ character that i suspect has always made crown so popular in the us (that sort of oaky, corny, vanilla quality), though with the rough edges of the standard crown evened out considerably. less sweet than standard crown. quite restrained. but behind that there’s some orange peel, and some hints toward a bumped-up rye quotient here—it’s a light, sweet, soft rye, though. bready. when you get your nose in just the right position, there’s a nice mixture of sweet, sour, and spicy rye that’s really nice (just ever so mild shades of lot 40)—but it’s really elusive, and weak, and god do i wish they’d bottle this stuff at 45% or even 43%. some red fruits—berries. toffee. maple. pickles? grass or hay. it does benefit from time in a way that i wasn’t suspecting, and it’s nice, but boy is it restrained and delicate. 

**taste:** thin, but there is a decent syrupiness to the body. devastatingly smooth (whether you want to take that in a good way or a bad way). again, that crown royal bourbon-lite™ of oak tannins, vanilla, and corn. but a nice rye spiciness surrounds it. again, orange peel. faintly bready.

**finish:** short. vanishes too quickly. hints of the rye again (a nice balanced spicy-sweetness). toasted wood, vanilla. nice balance, but it’s a there-and-gone sort of thing. you can tell the market segment being targeted here, the kind of person for whom “smoothness” is key.

**final thoughts:** this is a whisky with real potential that ultimately and sadly falls short, and is afraid to step out of the canadian whisky stereotype. that faint hint of some real, actual interesting rye character is *really* enticing, but the strength just isn’t there to make it come out in a real direct way, and that makes me sad. at the same time, here’s the weird thing: despite its shortcomings, i *really* enjoyed drinking this, and i’m having trouble explaining exactly why—perhaps the case of a good whisky that just doesn’t fit with what i wanted of it (there’s no doubt the smoothness and balance of this guy are a deliberate decision geared to a specific audience, and the master blender certainly deserves credit for retaining the cr character while smoothing out the edges *and* adding an extra shot of flavour). or perhaps—though i’ve never had this particular cr expression before—it’s a kind of pseudo-nostalgia factor, where i sip this and experience a warped memory of what i desperately *wanted* the regular crown to taste like when i was younger? i don’t know, but there’s something weirdly likeable here that i’m having trouble putting my finger on. 

of course it’s worth mentioning here as well that the plot thickens, and that there may be an explanation for some of the wild variance of scores between reviews here other than different tastes: because, rumours are circulating in a few places on the web (particularly on [whisky connosr](http://www.connosr.com/reviews/crown-royal/crown-royal-reserve/an-exceptional-batch-only/)) that the reserve is somewhat schizophrenic, and that there may be pretty significant variations from batch-to-batch that the company isn’t acknowledging—with batches apparently ranging from all-out rye bombs to fairly mute refinements of the standard crown royal character. if those stories are true, it’s certainly interesting, and i’d certainly love to get my hands on a bottle from a batch that i’ve heard some people rave about. this—though again, in a strange way i still rather like it—isn’t that batch. 

**score:** 82
