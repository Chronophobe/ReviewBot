hello ww, texacer here continuing his tour of canada eh.  next up:  **century reserve 15/25, 80 proof**


* color: pale straw
* nose: sweet glue. light floral.  
* taste: citrus and orange sugar.  light sweet maple.  slight vanilla. 
* finish: mild

another too light. just not getting the quality complexity that i'm looking for.  i'm not losing hope here, and i haven't tested the ones i'm looking forward too yet, but come on canada, try a little harder. 


&gt;68/100
