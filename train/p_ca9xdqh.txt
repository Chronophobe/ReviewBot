out at the liquor store today to stock up on the loads of bubbly that went on sale. saw a nip and thought, have not reviewed this yet, why not tonight?

**jameson (80 proof)**

color: burnished

nose: raspberries and strawberries muddled in stone, minerals, champagne, epsom salt, lemon seltzer, apple juice, confectionery sugar, butterscotch; solvent notes rest underneath but is never prominent; 

taste: unripe apples, zest, and berries initially, with an earthy, stone like undertone mid palate then cream, penny and straw; thin mouthfeel 

finish: little to none, lingering bitter acidity of metal and dirt; like sucking on an old, dirty battery

overall: the nose is well-composed. the taste is good at first but devolves into a metallic, earthy mess - that is if you get anything at all given its very thin palate. also, the bitter finish really shows this whiskey's weakness. i could forgive it for the loads of rich butterscotch that takes eons for it to open up to, but by that time anything else that is interesting - the crisp minerality and berry fruits - are lost to an earthy grain funk. this whiskey is meant to be consumed quickly. it is more impressive than most bottom shelf scotch blends. 

rating: good (77/100)
