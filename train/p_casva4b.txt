**tullamore dew**

ireland, blend, 40%

* color: pale gold

* nose: sweet malt, canned pineapple, oak, lime, tonic water, ginger, carrot

* taste: malt, sour apple rings, honey, peach, oak, hint of vanilla and licorice

* finish: bitter, lingers

would not be a bad whiskey, but the very bitter aftertaste like some medicine is quite offensive and disturbing and ruins it. to be mixed for irish coffee but not to sip neat.

**75/100**
