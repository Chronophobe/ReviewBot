hello scotchit!

i've only recently joined, but boy was it a nice time so far. there's a few things i'd like to share, and ask! first off, i'd like to thank all of you for your constructive comments and positive attitude. it's rare enough to see that on the interwebs, so i think it's worth a mention! now, onto the meat of the topic:

i've got a few bottles and samples, so i've put this picture for the thread and if you see anything you'd like reviewed, i'll jump on it. i intend to review everything from that shelf soon-ish. otherwise, i'll just keep on knocking the samples down one by one. i'll be posting a review for jw platinum label later today!

now, with that said, i've tried to use the tasting/nosing chart on the side of this subreddit, but i haven't found much in it, especially when it comes to fruits. i'm however using a chart i've found very useful right now so i thought i'd share it with you: [here](http://www.agroscope.admin.ch/php/modules/mediamanager/sendobject.php?lang=en&amp;image=nhzlpzeg7t,lnp6i0ntu042l2z6ln1ad1izn4z2qzpno2yuq2z6gpjcfdon_e2ym162bpybqjkaypeg-)

what's your experience with charts? are you using any other? maybe it would be interesting to see what the consensus is... personally i think the chart on the sidebar could use some refining, but you may differ! let the world know!

anyway, i think that's it for me... thanks for the good times so far and slainte!
