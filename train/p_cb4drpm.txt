hello worldwhisky! for my 1st review in r/worldwhisky, i'm reviewing a japanese whisky. although i normally drink scotch, i feel japanese is the closest whisky comes to scotch, outside of scotland. personally, i really enjoy the 12 year; i don't understand why it gets such a bad rep. of course, it doesn't even come close to the 18 year, but at $60/bottle (vs $150-200 for the 18), it aint no slouch. i hope yall enjoy my review.

** yamazaki 12 year**

- nose: citrus, lemon, vanilla, leaves, mango

- palate: spice, citrus, lemon, oak

- finish: spices, vanilla, mahogany, bitterness, warm/inviting, floral, fruity, medium length, pleasant floral aftertaste

- additional thoughts: simple palate, complex finish. definitely messes up your palate after drinking. water brings out japanese oak, floral, and additional fruit notes. adds a charred flavor that overwhelms the finish.

- score: 85

solidly drinkable, very pleasant across the board. no particularly strong flavors (aside from the lemon) means this is a good bet for non-scotch-drinking company. ++my girlfriend enjoys this. +++my brother, who normally maintains whisky "tastes like ass," said this was by far the best whisky i've given him to try (so far).
