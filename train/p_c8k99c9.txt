**sullivans cove port maturation cask strength,  60% abv**

*tasmanian single malt, barrel hh0528, bottle 275/372*

*barrel date: 24/10/2000, bottle date: 29/12/2007*

* nose: tawny port and xo cognac. dried figs, prunes and dates. canned peaches and pears. very rich and fruity. cadbury fruit &amp; nut. a bit of pine and fresh mint right at the back. nice...

* taste: full bodied, rich, oily and syrupy, followed by effervescent tartness. dry oak, tannins and coffee bitterness. rich 70% dark chocolate with sultanas. toffee apples, peanut brittle, hot peppers and a pinch of sea salt. candied orange skin and fruit chutney. wow...

* finish: fruity, peppery and oaky. macchiato with two sugars. a bit of oak spice and faint smokiness. medium length and left me wanting.

this shits all over the balvenie 21 portwood (which i gave 89/100, but i have to re-review it properly.) the nose is unbelievable and the taste is rich and decadent. a better finish would have propelled this to 95/100. that's not to say the finish is crap, it's great, just a little disappointing after the nose and taste. 

this dram  is tied with the bakery hill peated cs as my favourite aussie whisky.

&gt;**91/100**
