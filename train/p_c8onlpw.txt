uncletobys is [to blame with his moutai review](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/19i96r/review_kweichow_moutai/) so i foolishly promised to review the chinese whisky i have lying about the home.  the nice stuff (wuliangye/moutai) is from my inlaws, but the erguotou is a beijing special i brought back myself.

&gt; white house officials warned president richard nixon to avoid the stuff during his 1972 visit to china. “under no, repeat, no circumstances should the president actually drink from his glass in response to banquet toasts,” alexander haig, then an aide to henry kissinger, warned in a cable before mr. nixon’s arrival.

&gt;  “as the sweet fragrance of moutai wafted across the room, the american guests became intrigued, grins appeared on their faces, and they were visibly happy and relaxed” is how the communist party’s official account described the evening.

**red star erguotou / 56% abv / $1**

*tasted neat*

[er guo tou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/er_guo_tou) means "second pot head" (top cut second distillation) and takes six months to produce, made from sorghum in china.  it's beijing's "go to" blue collar drink.

* **color:** clear, nice green bottle
* **nose:** rubbing alcohol, plum, bileous vomit
* **taste:** sweet graininess, sticky black bbq sauce
* **finish:** quite long, lingering lemon and candy

of all the chinese liquor i've had, this actually ranks fairly high.  you can buy a 100ml flask-sized bottle for a few rmb which is the perfect [beijing winter tourist's companion](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elliott-back/4319171565/in/set-72157623196921981).

**kweichow moutai (2008 vintage) / 53% abv / $120**

*tasted neat*

moutai is known as "sauce fragrance" (yes there is [baijiu classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baijiu#classification)) which means it's particularly stinky.  this is the [favored drink](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/03/04/how-maotai-became-the-world-s-only-socialist-luxury-brand.html) of politicians and the chinese elite, and is a wedding staple.  the bottle has a marble in the neck so it goes glug glug when you pour it.  also sorghum-based.

* **color:** clear (again), in a white bottle with red label
* **nose:** industrial, again sweet plum, subtler than the er guo tou
* **taste:** starchy, smooth with a thicker texture, lemon and a bit floral
* **finish:** medium, acetone

after you start drinking it might be hard to stop.  i had bought an inferior bottle of this called "moutai prince" in a small size, i think 375 or 500ml, and proceeded to polish it off on the overnight train from shanghai to beijing.  i recall throwing up at least twice, i have never been that drunk before or after, but yet i suppose my efforts at hydration were not lost, as i woke up the next day ragged but without a hangover.

**wuliangye / 52% abv / $80**

*tasted neat*

wuliangye actually has more market share (45%) in china than maotai (30%).  the stuff is made from 5 grains: wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, and glutinous rice, hence the name.

* **color:** clear!!!
* **nose:** razor blades!  why is there paint thinner in my glass?  what are these black spots in front of my eyes?!
* **taste:** black licorice, absinthe, why am i scratching my head repeatedly!?
* **finish:** mom just made me drink the medicine :(
