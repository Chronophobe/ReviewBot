**nikka taketsura 21 year old**

japanese blended malt 43% abv

$155

**color:** orange-yellow

**nose:** extremely gentle. oak, chocolate, espresso.  it smells a bit sweet, it's very enticing.

**taste:** comes on strong and says hello in a big, inviting, way.  a bit spicy, some black pepper, sherry

**finish:** oak, very subtle smokiness (although, that could be alcohol).  it's almost a bit sweet towards the very end.

**comments:**  from the start this whisky just says "drink me".  i've said it before, i'm not a fan of blends, but this may have changed my mind.  unless "from the barrel" steps up in a big way, this will have the top spot.  the flavor just keeps developing, but it's subtle in how it does it.  this was crowned the worlds best blended malt whisky in 2010 and i can see why.

**score:** 95


**nikka whisky from the barrel**

japanese blended malt 51.4% abv

$44

**color:** orange-red

**nose:** sweet, dark chocolate

**taste:** sweetness from the nose carries through, caramel, vanilla, a bit of peat.  it certainly doesn't hit you like a cask strength normally would.

**finish:** warm, just a little bit peaty, i can't detect much else.

**comments:**  not nearly as good as the taketsura, which is a tough act to follow.  it's hard to remember this is cask strength, which is a little bit dangerous, overall, a good drink. i think it just squeaks out in front of the isle of skye.

**score:** 70, mostly because it's cask strength.
