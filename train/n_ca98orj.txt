i made a custom whisk(e)y box for a friend's birthday out of an unfinished wooden wine box kit from amazon. used green stain, and clear finish. created a custom label similar to jameson, and treated it to make it look antique-y by soaking it in tea, and tearing the edges. 

it's called o'shalleman's because we took a trip to ireland with our families together in 2011, and decided that (in true himym style) we were going to open a pub at our retirement. the name is a combination of our last names (o'shea and halleman).

fun project that took about 4-6 hours worth of work.
