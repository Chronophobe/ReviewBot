**balcones texas single malt, 53% abv**

&gt; a unique style of malt whisky - texas made, texas proud. balcones texas malt whisky is born of hundreds of years of distilling tradition transformed by a deep sense of place. mellow notes of sauteed pears and ripe fruit mixed with a lingering toasty malt character.

* nose: honeyed vanilla malt. resinous and sappy. oaky spice. caramelized banana and pear. candied orange peel. distant wood smoke. faint varnish in the background.

* taste: medium bodied and tart. creme caramel. sour citrus. grilled fennel. barley sugar and toasted cereal. mixed peel. desiccated coconut and cocoa. grape and apple skin. sandalwood. wax and mineral notes. grainy ethanol.

* finish: burnt toast. dark chocolate covered coffee beans. liquorice. biscuity and grassy. honey cheerios. medium-long and dry with lingering barrel char.

i'm impressed. i didn't really expect much from a texan single malt but this is very good. tastes a bit young but the flavours are there. a bold and spicy malt whisky with a lot of character.
