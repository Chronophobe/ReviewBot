boy am i excited to review this one for you. after the hullaballoo about them whipping a bunch of scotches in a tasting, i sought out a bar that carried this bad boy and paid a pretty penny for a dram. big mistake, as i now needed a bottle.

now i have one, and i get to review it for you fine folks.

so, the details: nas, single malt, non-chill-filtered and not colored. bottled at 53%. 
_________  

- **nose:** this is no shrinking violet… big buttery pear, grape, violets. extremely rich!
- **palate:** a ton of oak lends an astringency to an otherwise full, round body. hot alcohol on the palate, but not unpleasant. sweet, bourbon-like vanilla notes come through clearly, supported by some of the fruit notes found on the nose.  water tames it a little. lots of malty/cereal influence. 
- **finish:** at first it's sweet vanilla and alcohol heat, followed by that oak spice and astringency. lingers.
 
_________  

this whisky grabs me in  all the right ways… it seems a bit young, but really special, and often brings macallan cs to mind. the future of american craft distilling is certainly bright. 

**90/100**
