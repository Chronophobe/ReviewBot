{"name":"ReviewBot","tagline":"Reddit bot originally made for /r/Scotch and affiliated subs.","body":"ReviewBot is a Reddit Bot powered by [PRAW](http://praw.readthedocs.org/) (Python Reddit Api Wrapper).\r\n\r\nThe bot was originally made for the Reddit whisky network (/r/Bourbon, /r/Scotch and /r/WorldWhisky), but it can be used for any subreddit which has a classifiable type of comment (such as a review).\r\n\r\nBelow are the commands that work for /u/review_bot in the whisky network:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\nBelow are the commands Review_Bot looks for in the comments. All commands are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n### Generic Listing\r\n    /u/review_bot list\r\n\r\nLists up to 10 of the user's reviews across the /r/Whisky network.\r\n\r\n### Bottle Listing\r\n    /u/review_bot 'Caol Ila'\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    /u/review_bot \"Caol Ila\"\r\n\r\nLists up to 10 of the user's reviews which titles contain the phrase 'Caol Ila'. If the review has been added via the original review archive, the bot also searches for the appropriate provided bottle name.\r\n\r\nThe order doesn't matter and as stated above the search is case insensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Per subreddit Listing\r\n    /u/review_bot scotch\r\n    /u/review_bot bourbon\r\n    /u/review_bot worldwhisky\r\n\r\nLists up to 10 of the user's reviews from just one subreddit (/r/Scotch, /r/Bourbon *or* /r/WorldWhisky)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the bot for your own subreddit\r\nAt this moment I'm working on a revision of the bot. This should make it easier to adapt it for your needs.\r\nMore about this subject later (when the new revision is 'stable'). Want to know more right now?
